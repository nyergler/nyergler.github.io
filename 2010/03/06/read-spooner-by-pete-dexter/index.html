<section class="prose dark:prose-light">
<p><em>Spooner</em>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Dexter>Pete Dexter’s</a> latest novel, is not as consistent as <a href=http://yergler.net/blog/2010/02/28/read-the-paperboy-by-pete-dexter/>The Paperboy</a> , but that does not make it inferior. <em>Spooner</em> tells the story of a boy, Spooner, and his step-father, Calmer. Spooner is not smart, is not handsome, and is primarily talented at causing trouble for others. Pissing in the shoes of others, rolling cars down the hill, and throwing eggs at cars: these are the things Spooner is good at. Calmer, a former Navy man, is good at just about everything, and is particularly good at being patient and trying to rescue those in need of redemption. Like Spooner’s mother, Lily, who sees the world first as a personal affront to her.</p>
<p>Dexter uses language in a way that lets you feel the words in your mouth and taste the idiom and “flavor”; in his hands, the language of the South (<em>Spooner</em> begins in Georgia; <em>The Paperboy</em> in Florida) does not feel impersonated or propped up, but real and present. <em>Spooner</em> contains exposition that made me almost giddy with pleasure, re-reading paragraphs out loud on the bus, looking like a crazy person, I’m sure. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was in every sport Spooner ever played, on every team he ever joined, an outcast. Some kid who had been plucked from the safety of home and homeroom and tossed, often at the insistence of his own father, out into the world. Unprotected. Often this kid was the fattest, dopiest kid in school, someone who had been <em>it</em> every day of his life on the playgrounds, shunned or insulted one day, beaten up the next, and was now introduced to the rest of his life, which was more of the same except better organized, with the degree of abuse he suffered depending mostly on the mercies of the adults in charge.
I don’t know if I was exactly <em>that kid</em> on the team, but I could certainly pick him out a mile away, and knew enough to keep my distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Spooner</em> is told in the third person, but Dexter manages to convey the mental confusion and uncertainty the characters express in a way that reminded me of Paul Auster. Characters try to look at themselves and figure out what really happened: Did they really see what they think they saw? Where was the moment things went wrong? Could they have found another way through that situation? That ability to convey the introspection, uncertainty, and inner monologue of a character gives the story a depth: coming to the end of a paragraph is like coming up from under water, and you’re not really sure where you’ve wound up.</p>
<p><em>Spooner</em> is not perfect; one section, in particular, doesn’t feel like it “fits” with the rest. As a whole it’s a great story about two characters who care a great deal for each other, an original, expansive rendering of the father-son relationship.</p>
