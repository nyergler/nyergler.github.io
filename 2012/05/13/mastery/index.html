<section class="prose dark:prose-light">
<p>A few years ago I decided to take a writing class at City College of San Francisco. The class was creative non-fiction, memoir writing. I went into it expecting that it would be fun, but not difficult. When it came time to write my first assignment, I found that it actually was in fact more challenging than I expected. But I told myself to keep my butt in the chair, and keep writing. I completed the assignment and turned it in on a Thursday. The instructor handed our graded assignments back face down at the end of class on Tuesday. I kept mine face down as I walked out of the building, looking at it when I finally got to the street. “A”, followed by glowing and positive comments. I called my best friend and left him voicemail: “I just got my first assignment back, and I got an A!” I reported breathlessly. He later told me, “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you giggle before listening to that message.” In my mind I was already a writer. No, a Writer: capital “W”. I was going to go forward from that assignment and only get better, only have success, unleashing my heretofore undiscovered talent on the world. But that wasn’t the case. When I sat down to write the second assignment the next evening (“oh, I’ll just sit down and this will flow out of me; I know what I want to write about, how long can it take to just type it?”), nothing came out. Well, some words came out, but it was pretty clear they weren’t what I imagined. The words on the page were a pale reflection of the idea in my head. I struggled for a couple of hours before calling it a night. And I did not get an “A” on the second assignment.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this incident recently, thinking about why sometimes things feel like they flow and I stay with it, and sometimes they don’t and I put it down. I had a long flight and had brought a book with me: “Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-term Fulfillment”, by George Leonard. A colleague had recommended it to me as we talked about what it means to have mastery of something (in the case of our conversation, software engineering). It’s a short book, about 150 pages, and easy to read. The core thing I took away from it was that mastery is about pursuing a path for its own sake, not for the sake of a grade or a title. The path to mastery involves seeking instruction, practice, surrendering your ego, being intentional about what you want, and pushing yourself just past the edge of what’s comfortable or obvious. I think the most interesting thing about reading Mastery was how it crystallized other things I’ve been thinking about or reading since taking that writing class.</p>
<p>Julia Cameron, in The Artist’s Way, talks about “morning pages”: getting up and writing three pages, even if all you write is “I don’t know what to write”. Surrendering the idea of a polished product, practicing putting pen to paper, pushing yourself.</p>
<p>Annie Lamott, in “Bird by Bird”, talks about “shitty first drafts”: again, surrendering the idea of a polished product, of genius, and committing yourself to work.</p>
<p>And my print-making mentor, Katie Gilmartin, reminding me gently that Picasso didn’t make just one bull: he created the image again and again, practicing, improving his technique. In telling me that she reminds me that it’s not only acceptable to repeat yourself, it’s desirable.</p>
<p>Finally, when we interview engineering candidates, one of the things we look for is what they’re doing outside of their job. Some members of the team look for outside technical projects: are they interested in the field and in learning more about new things. That’s great, but I tend to look for “what are they making”. It might be software, it might be paintings, it might be improv. After reading “Mastery”, I think that I’m looking for a practice. Looking for something they’re doing just because they love it, not because they’re going to get paid, recognized, etc.</p>
<p>I think the path to mastery is the path of having a practice. What do I do again and again, not because I’m going to get an “A”, but because I love it and it feeds me.</p>
