Hi, my name is Nathan, and I’m a writer and [printmaker][1] . Some days I [write code][2], and some days [I ][3] [write][4]  [words][5] . Some days I write words [about][6]  [writing][7]  [code][8] . Occasionally I write about [free][9]  [software][10] .

I previously worked at [Creative Commons][11] , serving as Chief Technology Officer from 2007-2011. While there I was responsible for [CC Publisher][12], the [web services for integrating licensing][13], and architecting and building [the license infrastructure][14]. In 2008, I co-authored the [<span class="caps">CC</span>][15] [Rights Expression Language specification][15] (CC REL), which provides a technical model for describing licenses. I also developed the technical and metadata architecture for Creative Commons’ [public domain tools][16], and a digital copyright registry, [CC Network][17], based on [linked data][18]. I was the primary architect of Creative Commons’ search and discovery work, developing [prototype search tools][19] for open educational resources based on linked data and aggregation.

I was introduced to [monotype][20] and [linocut][21] print making by [Katie Gilmartin][22] in 2011.

My monotype work often involves exploring how stencils can be used to combine very graphical qualities with the one-off nature of monotype.

Some of my work is [available here][1].
