So this is my fourth (and hopefully final) attempt at a blog. With each
preceding instance I either became too lazy, too busy or too enamoured with
other blogging software to keep things up. This time will be different. I swear.

So my short term goals for yergler.net:

* make the templates not suck (well, suck less)
* get my photo albums uploaded and into a psuedo-manageable state
* post witty commentary and review of all things related to my life

Weâ€™ll see how many of those actually happen, and how soon. Stay tuned.
