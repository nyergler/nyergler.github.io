Well it’s Sunday evening, and I just realized what a lovely weekend it was. Lovely in that it was relaxed without a lot of committments, not in terms of weather. Saturday was gloomy and gray as only Indiana can be. I spent yesterday afternoon helping my parents clean out my grandmothers house, and then saw Runaway Jury. Excellent film.

Today was spent sleeping in and then writing the first draft of my English paper, “Relevant Information Retrieval: A Literature Review.” Woo-hoo. Of course, we rewarded my diligence by going to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Of all the horror movies we’ve watched lately, this is definitly the best. And it’s <span class="caps">WAY</span> better than that crap they call Cabin Fever.
