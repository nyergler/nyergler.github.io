So I survived the holidays and am back to work today. Yes, I did take some time over the weekend to realize just what I’m thankful for. No, I don’t want to talk about it.

So I’ve spent most of my day today working on a few fronts. First, trying to integrate help into WordCited. I’ll be damned if I can get it to work consistently, and I’m kicking myself for agreeing to do Windows development.

Second, I’ve been working (not just today, but for the last week or so) on squashing some [mozCC][1]  [bugs][2] . I’ve taken care of a few, and am preparing to release an upgrade to mozCC. If you’ve had problems with it, or have suggestions, now is the time to [let me know][3] .

Finally, I’ve been working on refactoring and improving my Python library for handling [Creative Commons][4]  metadata, [ccLicense.py][5] . I blogged about the need for improvements [here][6]  and am working to take care of those issues. It’s also going to finally get it’s own module in <span class="caps">CVS</span> in an effort to separate it from the validator.
