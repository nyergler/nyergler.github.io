After writing my [complaint][1]  about Word and word processing on Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, I decided to do “yet another” search for something to quell my angst. What I found suprised me. Pleasantly.

First, LyX has been Aqua-fied. Sort of. I found a [non-X11 distribution][2]  of [LyX][3]  which apparently uses Qt-Mac for it’s widgets. It’s nice: I have lots of LyX documents lying around I can now open and edit with ease. Of course, it’s still obviously not a first-class Mac citizen: keyboard shortcuts and file dialogs look totally wrong. That and, well, embarassingly enough, you can’t really print. Well, maybe some people can, but I couldn’t after an hour of fiddling, and really, that’s about all I can devote to it right now.

My other find is what really knocked my socks off. [Mellel][4]  is a shareware word processor, and with a price tag of $<span class="caps">29USD</span>, it’s absolutely amazing. <span class="caps">OK</span>, so it doesn’t import or export to Word, but it has an amazing set of features and doesn’t feel bloated or slow in the least. What’s more, it’s obviously built _for_ Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, and as such has the typography and layout controls we’ve come to expect. After using it to write a short curriculum guide this morning, I shelled out the purchase cost without hesitation.

To anyone looking for a real alternative for your personal word processing, I can’t recommend Mellel enough. It’s right there with [OmniGraffle][5]  and [OmniOutliner][6]  now in my “must-have” pile.
