So the American Family Association ran a poll on gay marriage last month, asking surfers whether they support gay marriage, support gay marriage but prefer the phrase “civil union” or oppose gay marriage. The bottom of the poll page promised that the results would be “taken to Congress.” I know, because I voted.

Now [Wired][1]  is [reporting][2]  that in an audacious display of hypocrisy (even for the <span class="caps">AFA</span>) that because the results were overwhelming in support of gay marriage (regardless of what you call it), they’ve decided to abandon the plan. My favorite part (the emphasis is mine):

“[homosexuals voted in the poll] to try to cause it to represent something other than **what we wanted it to**. And so far, they succeeded with that.”

What the hell. As I once told my mother: “Defense of marriage? With a divorce rate nearing 50%, I think y’all are doing fine without our help.”
