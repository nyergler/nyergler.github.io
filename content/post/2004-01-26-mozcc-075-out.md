Much later than I initially anticipated, mozCC 0.7.5 is now available. This release contains major architectural changes, and attempts to fix several reported bugs.

Beginning with this release, mozCC relies on [jsLib][1] . jsLib provides an excellent JavaScript library and is used by many Mozilla extensions. mozCC will attempt to install jsLib when it is installed. If you would like to install it seperately, you can find jsLib’s installation information [here][2] .

Changes in this release include:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    Support for the newly-announced Sampling and Sampling+ Licenses
  </li>
  <li>
    Uninstall and Upgrade functionality
  </li>
  <li>
    Better support for linked <span class="caps">RDF</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use of ccRdf.js for <span class="caps">RDF</span> parsing (relies on Mozilla’s excellent built-in <span class="caps">RDF</span> support)
  </li>
  <li>
    Numerous bug fixes
  </li>
</ul>

You can find installation links and instructions at the [main mozCC site][3] .

As always, [feedback][4]  is both welcome and desired. You can also file bug reports (please) at [MozDev][5] .
