PyCon 2004 is coming March 24 – 26, 2004. Like last year the conference will be held at the Cafritz Center on the campus of George Washington University in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>. And like [last year][1] , I’ll be presenting.

This year Vern and I will be talking about our experiences building an online classroom system, Stoa, for [Canterbury School][2] . I’ll post more information here as we get things put together.
