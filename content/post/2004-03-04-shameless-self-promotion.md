As I mentioned before, I’ll be presenting this year at [PyCon][1]  in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>. Vern and I will be talking about our experience developing Stoa, an online student information system and classroom portal. The Stoa code has been used internally for a while, and we’re finally releasing it under an Open Source license.

In prepartion for the conference I’ve been working on packaging and documenting things. You can find out all there is to know about Stoa in the [Stoa wiki][2] . Our presentation (what there is so far, that is), is also going into the [wiki][3] .
