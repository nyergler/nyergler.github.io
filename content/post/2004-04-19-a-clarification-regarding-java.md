In a [previous post][1]  I wrote about how <span class="caps">RMS</span>’s essay on writing free software for Java struck a chord with me. In summary, <span class="caps">RMS</span> states that writing free software in Java that uses <span class="caps">JRE</span> features not available in free software Java implementations (such as the [<span class="caps">GNU</span> Classpath][2] ) reduces the actual freedom of that software. I drew a parallel between non-free <span class="caps">JRE</span> features and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X-specific free software. It seems to me that free software, written to target Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X only, is not really free. I consider myself a pragmatist about many things, and I think this view fits: I use both Linux and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X and it’s frustrating when I can’t use the same software in both places.

<span class="caps">OK</span>, on to the point: I was thinking about this again in the shower this morning (I’m not really sure why), and I realized there is a pragmatic difference I failed to mention previously. I don’t code in Java regularly, mostly because I just have never had a compelling need. However, it does seem to me that there is a pragmatic difference between free software “constrained” by non-Free, zero cost software and that constrained by non-Free, costly software. That is, does that fact that Sun and <span class="caps">IBM</span> give away their respective JREs make the constraint more palatable than the constraint of Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, which as we all know costs money? Does, or should, the question of monetary cost enter into the equation of how Free software is?
