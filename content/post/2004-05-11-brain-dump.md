Since the semester ended (straight A’s, thanks for asking), I’ve been busy at work trying to get caught up on various projects. As such, little time for blogging, but here’s a dump of what I’m looking at and thinking of right now:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2004/05/06/kahleversusashcroft.html">Kahle v. Ashcroft</a> , the new front in the copyright battle
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oyez.com/oyez/frontpage">Oyez</a> : who knew that interactively browsing biographies of former Supreme Court justices could be so enthralling, or that I’d end up listening to the oral arguments of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oyez.com/oyez/resource/case/1526/">Eldred v. Ashcroft</a> on my way to work for a week?
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://tech.canterburyschool.org/tech/LoginManager">LoginManager</a>, a seemingly abandoned product for Zope 2.x that we’ve adopted at work in an effort to bring it forward to Zope 2.7 compatibility
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>, still my favorite way to build servers that do a particular task and do it well
  </li>
</ul>

Hmmm… there seem like there’ve been more “I should blog this” thoughts than this list in the past week; I guess I really do need to “just do it.”
