You may have heard that [Apple][1]  released a new version of the [iPod][2]  this week. How could you avoid it? They made the cover of [Newsweek][3] , in an **election year**, the week before the Democratic National Convention. Does anyone else question the relative importance of the iPod in the current news environment? I mean, I love my iPod and there’s no way I’d give it up, but cover of Newsweek? Probably not.

![Irrational exuberance over new iPod &#64; Apple Store][4]

I was walking from my hotel to work Wednesday and passed San Francisco’s Apple Store. The <span class="caps">UPS</span> truck was unloading a stack of boxes at the back door. Store emloyees, clad in their Bondi-blue t-shirts, were rabidly tearing into a box. A woman pulled out what I surmise to be the new iPod box (also Bondi blue), held it in the air, jumping up and down, practically giggling.
