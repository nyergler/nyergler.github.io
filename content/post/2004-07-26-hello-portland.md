I arrived in Portland on Saturday night and in the 48 hours since have fallen in love with the [<span class="caps">MAX</span>][1] . The <span class="caps">MAX</span> is Portland’s light rail public transport, and while it doesn’t go everywhere, it’s darn handy. Our hotel is right next to a <span class="caps">MAX</span> stop, so getting around is pretty easy. Garrett and I spent yesterday wandering around Portland, getting the lay of the land. We didn’t actually do any “classic” site-seeing, but did do a little shopping and enjoyed the lack of sales tax. Go Oregon!

Today is the start of the <span class="caps">OSCON</span> tutorials. I’m attending an introductory session on <span class="caps">XSLT</span> this morning, which, while a little dry, is definitly informative. [We’ll][2]  be introducing an <span class="caps">XML</span>+<span class="caps">XSLT</span> version of the [license selection][3]  engine soon, so I guess it’s good that I get up to speed. This afternoon I’ll be attending a tutorial on programming using [Rendezvous][4]  (nay, [ZeroConf][5] ), which seems to hold possibilities for <span class="caps">CC</span>. I can honestly say I have no idea what sort of possibilities, or where they’ll crop up, but it seems like a technology that would be useful for remixing/collaboration. Somehow. Somewhere.
