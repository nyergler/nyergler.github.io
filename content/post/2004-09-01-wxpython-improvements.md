[wxPython][1]  has long been my favorite toolkit for developing cross-platform interfaces that actually work. It’s not perfect, but it’s a hell of a lot closer than other alternatives I’ve tried.

I’m using wxPython in [ccTag][2]  for [Creative Commons][3] . I just downloaded the new version, 2.5.2.8, and it’s most notable new feature is **not** all of the Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X improvements (although those are cool and needed), but rather the improved documentation. For a long time the best documentation for wxPython has been the [documentation][4]  for [wxWidgets][5] , it’s C++ backend. So you would look at the C++ documentation, translate the methods in your head, and hope you got the translation right.

Now, thanks to [EpyDoc][6]  and lots of work by Robin, we have the beginnings of [real wxPython documentation][7] . It’s amazing how much more productive I feel using them than the C++ docs, which I had sort of resigned myself too. Great work, Robin.
