[Lessig][1]  [reports][2]  that Robert Greenwald, Producer/Director of the anti-<span class="caps">FOX</span> News polemic (and damned fine film) [Outfoxed][3] , has released the original interview footage under a [Creative Commons][4]  license. The footage is available for remix at the [Internet Archive][5]  and on [torrentacracy][6] . Very cool.

Hopefully we’ll see more filmmakers, and especially documentary filmmakers, licensing their source material in order to create a wider variety of works that will help promote discussion and conversation on important issues. Hmmm… does that imply that <span class="caps">CC</span> licensing promotes “fair and balanced” coverage of an issue?

On a slightly related note, after seeing Outfoxed, all I want to see is a remix of the Blackeyed Peas hit single “Shut Up” featuring footage of Bill O’Reilly. Now that would be quality entertainment.
