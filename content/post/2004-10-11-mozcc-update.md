From the [mozCC News][1]  page:

> mozCC 0.9.0 has been released. This upgrade includes support for the new [Developing Nations][2]  license, as well as improved detection and support of the [Sampling and Sampling+][3]  licenses.
It’s not a huge upgrade, but more of a maintenance release; [check it out][4]  and [let me know][5]  if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.

I also just realized that the screenshots on the site are horribly out of date, displaying a details dialog that’s be gone for half a dozen releases. [Here’s][6]  a new screenshot, showing off the new details dialog. And by “new” I mean “added in the last 9 months.”
