Today is [World <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Day][1] . I’m not feeling particularly eloquent today, so I’ll let the indomitable Larry Kramer do it for me. Larry’s [speech][2]  (via [QueerDay][3] ), delivered in New York in early November, reads like a parental lecture to the gay community. And as much as I hate to admit it, it may be a lecture members of our community need to hear.

Go, read, mourn, remember.
