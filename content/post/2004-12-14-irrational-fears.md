I place way too much importance on what people think about me. Ever since a relative stranger called me a “college drop-out” (which technically I am, although I’m working on finishing my degree now), I’ve had this abiding fear that my employer (any one of them) was going to discover what a sham I am (or think myself to be), and fire me for extreme incompetence.

So this morning, I had a total [Sally Field][1]  moment: [“You like me, you really like me.”][2]
