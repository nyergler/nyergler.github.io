So I’m sitting here at the car dealership, waiting for Garrett’s car to be serviced, working on my final paper for “Religion and Culture”. I needed some notes from earlier in the semester, so I pulled my <span class="caps">USB</span> flash drive out of my pocket, plugged it into my laptop (running Gentoo Linux and Gnome 2.8), and prepared to figure out just what the appropriate device name was so I could get it mounted and copy the file off of it. And then it happened. I switched to an empty desktop, and sitting on my desktop was an icon: **usbdisk**. “Well that can’t be right,” I think to myself. There wasn’t nearly enough pain involved! I mean, what good is an operating system if my _mother_ could use it? <span class="caps">OK</span>, maybe not my mother, but you get the idea.
