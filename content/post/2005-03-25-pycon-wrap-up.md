PyCon is over, and I head back to balmy Indiana tomorrow. Overall PyCon was once again an excellent conference. I will, however, remember this as “The Year of Stairs.” For the first time ever the conference was split between the 1st and 3rd floors of the Marvin Center at <span class="caps">GWU</span>, and as a result I climbed lots of stairs. And my room is on the 8th floor of Hotel Lombardy, which has a slow, small elevator with an actual elevator operator. So as a result I’ve been using the stairs instead. Am I ever out of shape.

As with past years, there’s lots I want to look into post-PyCon. So in no particular order:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    I had the opportunity to talk about <a class="reference external" href="http://roundup.sf.net">Roundup</a> with it’s principal developer, Richard Jones. I’m hoping to modify a Roundup tracker to help manage crash reports from <span class="caps">CC</span> applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Yarn looked darn cool, and I want to explore the possibility of building a “desktop information client” that uses Yarn to consume email, <span class="caps">RSS</span>, etc. I’m just not satisfied with my current email clients, and Yarn looks like a very capable tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    I want to take another look at Zope 3’s component <span class="caps">API</span>, and how it might work outside of Z3.
  </li>
  <li>
    Traits looks like a cool way to do type checking and validation in applications. When they actually ship code, it’ll be worth looking at.
  </li>
  <li>
    I want to download Chandler 0.5 when it’s available and see what I can do with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    I want to look again at rule based “inferrence” engines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lots of efficiency and implementation talks made me want to download the source to Python and start seeing how Python works under the hood.
  </li>
</ul>

But first, ccPublisher maintenance release and catching up at work.
