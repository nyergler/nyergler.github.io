Last time I visited by physician for my quarterly meds check, I mentioned the fact that I frequently feel fatigued and exhausted by mid-morning. He referred me to a neurologist, and over the weekend I had a sleep study performed. This morning the neurologist’s office called and confirmed Garrett’s prediction: I have severe obstructive [sleep apnea][1] . I go back in tomorrow night for another night of observation, and to be fitted for a <span class="caps">CPAP</span> machine. While I’m looking forward to the increased rest and alertness that I’ve been told I can expect, I’m amazed at how [medieval looking][2]  the head gear fixtures are. Regardless, I’m really hoping to get the machine and gain some experience sleeping with it before heading to PyUK in a couple of weeks.

This weekend I’m heading over to Cleveland for [Notacon][3] . The [schedule][4]  looks nice and geeky, so I’m expecting a good weekend. I’m particularly interested in hearing what [this guy][5]  has to say about Creative Commons.
