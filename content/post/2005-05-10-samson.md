My Mom and Dad have always been taken with our dogs, Bosco and Madeline. So for Mother’s Day, we took a chance and got my mom a puppy, Samson. We did this with my dad’s blessing, but as he repeatedly pointed out “It’s gonna be an interesting Mother’s Day.”

It actually went really well. We picked up Samson from the breeder on Wednesday, and he stayed with us until Saturday when we went to my sister’s house for Mother’s Day. Samson is a Schnoodle, a Schnauzer-Poodle mix. As such, he’ll top out at about 7 pounds. Tiny.

From the daily reports I’m getting from my parents, it sounds like he’s enjoying his new home. Which is good, since after only 3 days, I miss him terribly. Hopefully Mom and Dad will get as much joy from him as we get from our dogs.
