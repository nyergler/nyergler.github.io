So I’m sitting at the coffee shop, up since 4 <span class="caps">AM</span>, more than a little sleep deprived working on finishing my software engineering presentation for this morning.Â  And I’m listening to the [Muriel’s Wedding][1]  soundtrack, and I have the uncontrollable urge to kick back my chair and do the swinging arm dance to <span class="caps">ABBA</span>’s Waterloo.Â  <span class="caps">OK</span>, I’m going just a little bit crazy.
