So it looks like I’ll be reprising my [Purdue <span class="caps">LUG</span> talk][1]  at least two more times — once for the [Canterbury High School][2]  student body (March 8 — email me for time and details if you’re in the area), and again for the [Fort Wayne <span class="caps">LUG</span>][3]  for their March meeting (March 16, 7:00pm).

Obviously the content will be slightly different each time. The entire discussion of metadata and <span class="caps">RDF</span> will be excised for the high school presentation, and the copyright background and context beefed up. The goal is to leave students with a better understanding of what copyright is and why they should be outraged.

Slides as usual will be forthcoming.
