Since I’m traveling for two weeks and won’t get my hair did while on the road, I also won’t get my fix of People Magazine (and Teen People, natch). So I’m glad Ted is there to keep me up to date on breaking news: [Lance is Gay][1] . Must have been a slow news cycle if this is a cover story (even for People) — didn’t we see _someone_ (**anyone**) paying a hooker this week?

And yes, the first time I saw NSync on <span class="caps">MTV</span>, I thought, “wow, that guy takes it up the ass.”
