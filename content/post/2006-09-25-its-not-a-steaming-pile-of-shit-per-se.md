Luis has [some suggestions][1]  for the [OpenOffice.org][2]  team, the same ones he made [two years ago][3] . Users don’t necessarily care about feature parity, they care about performance and ease of use. I’ll use [Gnumeric][4]  over OOo Calc any day, but presentations are really just medieval. PowerPoint isn’t great (especially when compared to Keynote’s two-display aware presentation mode), but Impress makes baby Jesus cry.

Of course, I also do think that the idea of writing a sane plugin interface for OOo could be a step in the right direction for usability. One could argue Firefox has been so successful with the “less is more” approach because it provides a good plugin interface which allows people to add features they’re missing from a larger, more bloated package. While OOo currently has some idea of a plugin, it’s not fully baked (<span class="caps">IMHO</span>). I recently looked at implementing a Creative Commons licensing interface for OOo, similar to the [one Microsoft shipped][5]  this summer. When I compare my initial experience with my experience when I started doing <span class="caps">MS</span> Office “development” nearly 10 years ago, there’s no comparison: Office 97’s plugin model kicks OOo’s ass. Of course, in all fairness it may be more accurate to say that Office 97’s Plugin **Documentation** kicks OOo’s ass, but is that really a different statement?
