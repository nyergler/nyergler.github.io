Dear LazyWeb,

<span class="caps">OK</span>, I’m convinced. Heirarchical categories for blogging are a pain in the ass. I’d rather tag things, and like that [WordPress][1]  automagically add <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rel="tag"</span></tt> to my category links. But I hate the check box selector, since I can type faster than I can mouse. Is there a plugin that will give me a single text field in the editor which:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    auto-completes space-delimited words to existing categories
  </li>
  <li>
    and if they don’t exist, creates them when the post is published?
  </li>
</ul>

Eternally grateful,

Nathan

**<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>** Apparently I really _am_ “that lazy”; check out [cat2tag][2]  which does 99% of what I want (it doesn’t do tab-completion, but I can live with that).

<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
  <col class="field-name" /> <col class="field-body" /> <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      date:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">
      2007-02-24 12:38:36
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      wordpress_id:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">
      491
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      layout:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">

  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
