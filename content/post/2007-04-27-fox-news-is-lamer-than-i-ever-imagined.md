I’ve been working at a local coffee shop for the past hour, and for most of that Fox News (on the obligatory, hideous plasma television) has been showing a car chase in <span class="caps">LA</span>. But as far as I can tell, it’s, well, just a car chase. And over the entire thing there’s this inane discussion of jurisdiction, what his intentions are, etc. What I love is the little ticker: “Driver may be heavily tattooed”. And then the voice over, “Well, I guess he figures he’s getting his 15 minutes of fame.” Huh, ya think? And who’s providing that? And all the while the white on red <span class="caps">ALERT</span> pulsates. Maybe I’ve just missed the part of the story where he has a hostage, or, well, anything newsworthy. But no, it’s apparently just some guy who stole a shitty rusted out Camry.

Maybe instead of “Fair and Balanced” they could brand their news service “Sensationalist and Explotative.” Just a suggestion.
