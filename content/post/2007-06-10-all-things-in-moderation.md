Just a house-keeping note, [Akismet][1]  seems to be missing lots of single-word comment link spam (ironically many of the comments have “sorry” as the body text; yeah, right). So moderation is now on for all comments, at least for a while. It wouldn’t be such a big deal except that I haven’t been paying daily attention to the site lately, so when I do get around to it, there’s a pile to weed out. If I start having more time for the site, moderation will be lifted. Thanks.
