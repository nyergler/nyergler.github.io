I really love task lists — especially the crossing off part — but lately they haven’t really been helping me out. Between the day job, consulting work, dating, and a more active social life than I had in Indiana, it seems like I never quite get to the crossing off part. This has become particularly clear at work where I use two simple labels for email: <tt class="docutils literal">action</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">reply</tt>. I’m a little ashamed to admit that the <tt class="docutils literal">action</tt> queue currently has 196 items in it, the oldest dating to August of last year. My <span class="caps">CC</span> inbox has 404 messages in it right now, of which 182 are starred. Starring is supposed to indicate something that needs my attention. Somehow this doesn’t seem productive. Mike, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry. Believe me, I’m sorry.

So I’m trying something a little different. This evening I watched the [Google Tech Talk][1]  by Merlin Mann on [Inbox Zero][2] . While the second half played I managed to clear out my yergler.net inbox.

Tomorrow I’m planning to [create an email <span class="caps">DMZ</span>][3]  and begin at zero with my work inbox. Just keeping the flow of information to a reasonable level is just the first step, though.

I’ve had a [Remember the Milk][4]  (<span class="caps">RTM</span>) account for quite a while but never got in the habit of using it. After watching an [introduction][5]  to [Tasque][6] , I decided to look again. Tasque is a simple task list application for Gnome, in the same vein as [Tomboy][7]  for notes. I love Tomboy. I think I’ll love Tasque, too.

I don’t know if the <span class="caps">RTM</span> elves have been hacking away at the site since I last looked or if I just never really dug in, but it actually seems to have the features I want in a task list. And there’s even a handy [blog post][8]  on how you can use <span class="caps">RTM</span> to <span class="caps">GTD</span> (get things done).

Finally, the piece that ties both sides together: their [Firefox extension][9] . My workflow this evening looked like this:

<ol class="arabic simple">
  <li>
    Go to the next email
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide that had some action associated with it
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the <tt class="docutils literal">action</tt> label to it, which also created it as a task to <span class="caps">RTM</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Later, when skimming through the <tt class="docutils literal">action</tt> list I saw one I could knock out in a few minutes. And when I finished and removed the <tt class="docutils literal">action</tt> label, the task in <span class="caps">RTM</span> was marked as complete. Sweet.
  </li>
</ol>
