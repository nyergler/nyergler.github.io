Another example of the power of [young adult fiction][1] .

I visited my family in Indiana over Thanksgiving. On my flight back from Chicago, I was upgraded to first class, seated next to a girl who appeared to be about twelve or thirteen, traveling as an unattended minor. As I sat down she was scribbling furiously in a notebook. She looked up and I smiled. “Hi, there.”

“What’s _pithy_ mean?” she responded, pencil poised to record my answer. My mind went nearly blank; this was not the question I was expecting to answer in the middle of a day of traveling.

“Uh, a short, compact phrase; witty?”

I must have telegraphed more confidence in my answer than I felt: “Thanks,” she said curtly, and went back to her notebook. I pulled out the _\`Specials <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials\_(novel)>\`\__, by David Westerfeld; Dan and Monya had given my _\`Uglies <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uglies>\`__ and _\`Pretties <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretties>\`__ for my birthday just before I left, and after tearing through them, I’d picked up _Specials_ for the trip back. My traveling companion looked up and saw the cover, suddenly becoming animated.

“Oh my god. You’re reading _Specials_. That’s so awesome.”

“Yeah, I know, it sort of is,” I replied, reverting to a tone more appropriate for gum snapping and borrowing the car than for grown men. “Yeah, like, I read _Uglies_, and _Pretties_, and now I’m on _Specials_; _Uglies_ was great, and _Pretties_ was <span class="caps">OK</span> — a bit of a slow down— but _Specials_ is great so far.” Capsule review.

“Totally. I totally agree. Oh my god. So cool.” I seemed to have made a friend, making up for any issues with my vocabulary performance earlier. “Do you have any other authors you recommend?” she asked.

I suggested [Octavia Butler][2] , thinking to myself, “kid, this shit is going to blow your mind.” She dutifully wrote it down, checking the spelling as she went.

“I’m writing a story,” she offered. “Sort of science fiction; I mean, it’s set in the future. Well, time has passed from the present; I _need_ the reader to understand that to get the plot.” I continued to nod in solemn agreement and she looked down at her notebook, fingering the pages a moment before snapping her attention back to me.

“Are you a good reader?” How does a thirty-three year old man answer such a question?

“Uh, yeah, I think I’m <span class="caps">OK</span>; I like to read,” I answered.

“You know how you can tell a good reader?” She didn’t wait for my reply. “They write down the recommendations from other good readers.” She proceeded to give me some recommendations, which I made sure to write down, not wanting to sully my good reader image.

I finished _Specials_ on the flight home, and it was a fun read. But on my traveling companion’s recommendation, I’ll be checking out the final book in the [series][3] , _\`Extras <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extras\_(novel)>\`\__, from the library — “it’s totally a let down.” So sayeth the good reader.
