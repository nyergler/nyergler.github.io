Since [moving][1]  to our new neighborhood, I’ve been cooking a lot more, particularly from the church cookbook I grew up with (see also, [my post on Sugar Crème Küchen][2] ). Since this sort of food seems to be a little uncommon on the west coast, and has been well received by my friends, co-workers, and — importantly — Richard, I’ve decided to start blogging about it.

You can follow my (likely intermittent) progress at [thedutchdelight.com][3] . And because this is, you know, social, you can follow the progress on [identi.ca][4]  or [twitter][5] , as well.
