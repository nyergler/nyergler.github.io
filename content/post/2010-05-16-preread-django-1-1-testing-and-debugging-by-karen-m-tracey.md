Another Packt Publishing title is on the way for review, _\`Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging <http://www.packtpub.com/django-1-1-testing-and-debugging/book?utm\_source=yergler.net&utm\_medium=bookrev&utm\_content=blog&utm\_campaign=mdb\_003267>\`\__, by Karen M. Tracey. Django 1.2 [ships tomorrow][1] , and I’m looking forward to the book: testing is one of the things that helps software evolve, but it’s also one of the things that’s easiest to ignore on a project. I say this to myself as much as anyone: even though I know tests will make my life better in the long run, when I start hacking, sometimes they’re the furthest thing from my mind. Books about how to test, and how to do it effectively, are definitely a good thing for me.

The <span class="caps">PDF</span> preview of [chapter 3][2]  (basic unit testing) looks good, and the table of contents looks like a good overview of basic tools and techniques. I’m particularly looking forward to reading about integrating Django with other testing tools (chapter 5), and using Django with <tt class="docutils literal">pdb</tt> (chapter 9). I’m looking forward to learning more about testing my Django applications — and hopefully how I can form better habits around testing.
