My first reaction to reading [Asheeh’s reflections on commitments][1] : “Yes, and I wish I’d learned that about ten years earlier than I did.” And then I remember that it’s not something you learn once; tending to your committments — and making them with care — is a life-long practice. Practicing is hard, but it’s preferrable to encountering the <span class="caps">OOT</span> killer.
