As I mentioned [last month][1] , there were a few improvements to [Hieroglyph][2]  sitting in the master branch, awaiting a release. Now that PyCon is over, I&#8217;ve cut the [Hieroglyph 0.5.5][3]  release. This is primarily a bug fix release, and it feels good to fix a bunch of issues that I discovered as I used [Hieroglyph][2]  to develop and present [Effective Django][4] .

In addition to fixing half a dozen bugs, I also reviewed and revised almost all of the documentation for this release. [Asheesh][5]  used Hieroglyph for his [talk on web scraping][6]  at PyCon last week, and it was really interesting to get feedback from him about what worked and what was confusing. As a result, there&#8217;s a new [Getting Started][7]  guide. There&#8217;s still work to be done, in particular in the [Advanced Usage][8]  document; hopefully that will get rewritten and expanded soon.

Asheesh&#8217;s feedback demonstrated to me how little I know about why people use (or don&#8217;t) use Hieroglyph, and what&#8217;s difficult or confusing to them that I take for granted. If you&#8217;ve used Hieroglyph, thought about it and rejected it, or tried it and been frustrated, I&#8217;d like to hear about your experience. You can email me at <tt class="docutils literal">nathan&#64;yergler.net</tt>, or ping me on [Identi.ca][9]  or [Twitter][10] : &#64;nyergler
