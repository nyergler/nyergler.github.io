A dear friend sent me a photograph she took from [Candlestick Point][1]  shortly after I made a print of a canal in Amsterdam. She noted that I&#8217;d been working with images of water, and thought of me when she looked out over the bay. I&#8217;ve been thinking about the image for a while, and started working on the actual print a couple months ago. I was finally ready to print on Wednesday.

</div>

In this case I made a drawing from the photograph, transferred it the lino plate, and then starting thinking about how to actually carve things away. I was about 90% of the way done when I scanned the plate, as an experiement. I think it&#8217;s pretty interesting to look at, too. The rocks, in particular, are something new for me. It&#8217;s taken me a while to ease into using parallel lines like that to indicate shading and shape. It&#8217;s a technique I&#8217;ve seen others use very effectively, and I&#8217;m excited to develop it for my own work.
