Last week when I was printing my line study, I had a couple extra hours in the studio. I&#8217;d previously drawn the plates for a Fast Pass double-plate print, so I quickly carved it as a fun distraction. The Fast Pass was the [<span class="caps">SFMTA</span>][1]  monthly pass card when I moved to San Francisco in 2007. It&#8217;s since been supplanted by Clipper, but most of my friends have some emotional attachment to the Fast Pass. You had to get a new one every month, and the colors changed each time, often appearing almost seasonable. I have a collection of the Fast Passes that passed through my hands, and it seems like [I&#8217;m not alone][2] .

As a draft print that took about 90 minutes to carve, I&#8217;m happy with the result. I&#8217;m particularly happy with how the <span class="caps">MUNI</span> logos came out. This is one of the first prints I&#8217;ve done with text on it, so I think the next thing I&#8217;d like to work on is cleaning up the text carving a bit.
