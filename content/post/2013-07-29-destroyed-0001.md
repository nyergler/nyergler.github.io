Some people blog their way through [Knuth][1]  or [<span class="caps">SICP</span>][2] . My attention span is somewhat shorter lately. I&#8217;ve recently begun watching Gary Bernhardt&#8217;s excellent [Destroy All Software][3]  screencasts, and I thought it&#8217;d be fun to blog my way through it with a series of short posts on what I learned from each episode. I&#8217;ve watched a few as I start this, and I think that if you write software and care about writing _good_ software, you should probably go buy <span class="caps">DAS</span> now.

I watched [Episode 1][4]  on my way to <span class="caps">OSCON</span> about a week ago. In it Gary works through building a small <tt class="docutils literal">bash</tt> script to calculate some statistics on a git repository (for example, how many lines of code there were at given points in time). The git plumbing bits were pretty interesting, but it was the actual process that was really educational.

One of the first things he also does is map a key to save and then run his script. I almost found myself coveting [Vim][5]  for a moment, because it seems obvious now that having an immediate feedback loop is actually superior to switching between Emacs and a terminal.

As Gary builds out the script, he points out a few things, like using <tt class="docutils literal">set <span class="pre">-e</span></tt>, and &#8220;always quote your arguments&#8221;. (It makes a missing argument fallback to an empty string, which programs like <tt class="docutils literal">grep</tt> are perfectly happy with.) That sort of casual, fingertip knowledge is a joy to watch. I guess I haven&#8217;t written enough in <tt class="docutils literal">bash</tt> to know better than to check my exit codes manually for things. <tt class="docutils literal">set <span class="pre">-e</span></tt> is obviously better. Way better.

And have you ever considered that <tt class="docutils literal">bash</tt> control structures like <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> have a <tt class="docutils literal">stdin</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>? They do. It seemed obvious once I saw him do it, and when I think about the way <tt class="docutils literal">bash</tt> works, it makes sense in a consistency sort of way. But until now I&#8217;d never considered piping the output of, say, <tt class="docutils literal">grep</tt> to a control structure.

Watching <span class="caps">DAS</span> <span class="caps">S1E1</span> I learned a few things about shell scripting that seem really fundamental, which I wish I&#8217;d have known about for, well, years. I also realized that I have this weird mix of git knowledge: I understand that it&#8217;s a directed acyclic graph and a bunch of the underlying structures. I also am proficient at using [magit][6]  to manipulate a repository within Emacs. The [git porcelain][7] ? Not so much.

Finally, I thought it was interesting to see and listen to Gary refactoring a bash script using some of the same principles that I use when looking at Python code. Specifically, wanting to make code easy to _read_, not just execute.
