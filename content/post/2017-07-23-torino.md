    I printed my last practice print yesterday before heading to Lincoln. I had this drawn on the plate for the better part of a year, based on a photo from one of my trips to Torino for Creative Commons years ago. Friday evening I sat down and started carving; yesterday afternoon I printed it. 8&#8243; x 10&#8243; on Pescia.
