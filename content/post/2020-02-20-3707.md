An interesting <a href="https://blog.leahhanson.us/post/recursecenter2016/haiku_icons.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">write-up of the Haiku Vector Image Format</a>; what particularly stood out to me, though, was this description of vector formats:

> One of the big advantages of vector formats is that theyâ€™re easy to resize; because you know what the shape is supposed to be (i.e. a circle), you can render it very small or very large without distorting it.

I&#8217;ve always thought of them in terms of math vectors, and while accurate, that doesn&#8217;t really capture _why_ we might prefer vectors to bitmaps.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the &#8220;why&#8221; is more interesting.
