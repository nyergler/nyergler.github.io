Descriptors, like meta-classes, are a feature of Python that I didn’t really
understand up until now. Raymond Hettinger has written an excellent [How-To
Guide for Descriptors][1], which clearly explains and demonstrates their use. My
biggest suprise is that (unlike meta-classes) I already knew how to use
Descriptors, I just didn’t have the vocabulary to adequately explain them or an
understanding of the underlying machinary.

Reading explanations of advanced Python features always leaves me feeling a
little overwhelmed, yet incredibly empowered: “you mean I can do **that** with
so little code?”
