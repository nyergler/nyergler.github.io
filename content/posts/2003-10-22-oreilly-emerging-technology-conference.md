Registration just opened for the [Emerging Technology Conference][1] , happening February 9-12, 2004 in San Diego. I’ve never been, but three things are motivating me to go. First, I’ve been to <span class="caps">OSCON</span> and loved it. Second, I’ve been to San Diego and loved it. Finally, the [sessions][2]  look killer. Not only are sessions discussing the social aspects of software, but Python will be [represented][3]  by the ever impressive [Twisted][4]  folks.
