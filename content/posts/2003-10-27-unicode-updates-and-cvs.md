ccValidator 1.1.2 is now available [here][1] . Fixes include the addition of non-standard Japanese codecs (including Shift_JIS) and further Unicode fixes. I still need to add support for Chinese and other encodings not found in Python’s default <tt class="docutils literal">codecs</tt> package. As always, the current release is available for your validation enjoyment at <http://www.yergler.net/projects/ccvalidator> .

I’ve also created a <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository for my projects, including ccValidator. You can browse it via the web at <http://www.yergler.net/cvs> . I’m unable to offer pserver access with my webhost, so I’ll be adding a cron job to produce nightly tarballs real soon now.
