Every now and then I’m forced (or agree) to return to the world of Windows only development. Such is the case with WordCited, my upcoming Microsoft Word plug-in.

**WordCited** is a plug-in for Microsoft Word 2000 and <span class="caps">XP</span> (and possibly 2003, once I test it) which eases the pain of creating <span class="caps">MLA</span> [<span class="caps">STRIKEOUT</span>:Bibliography] Works Cited entries. It currently handles all sorts of print and internet sources, and will also handle media sources (audio tape, <span class="caps">CD</span>, etc) when it’s finally released. I’m also considering adding support for the <span class="caps">APA</span> format, but that will come later.

So why return to the world of Windows for WordCited? Because I had a customer. A patient customer. A customer who has yet to call me on the fact I’m nearly 45 days late. But it’s coming; real soon now. And when it does, it will be available here. Well maybe not here, exactly, but I’ll be sure to announce the location. Not that I believe there will be a mad rush to download, but because after all the cursing and ranting about Office <span class="caps">COM</span> plug-in development, I need to brag somewhere.
