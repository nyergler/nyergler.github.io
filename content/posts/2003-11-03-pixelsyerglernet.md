In December, 2001 I bought my first digital camera, a Canon Digital Elph. I bought it because some of my friends (Mike, [Mark][1] ) took amazing pictures of their lives, and I was incredibly envious of these snapshots of life they had collected. My observations of both of them made me want to be the kind of person who takes lots of pictures. I don’t think that sentence really says what I mean, but I’m also not sure how to properly articulate it.

So I bought the camera and took lots of pictures for a few months. Of course, it tapered off soon after. But lately I’ve been wanting to record moments in my life. I think this stems from the realization that I’ve taken very few pictures this year, and yet so much has happened; we bought a house, have a new dog, etc. Things I should have recorded.

With that in mind I’ve dusted off the pictures I took over the past few years and created [My Life in Pixels][2] , at pixels.yergler.net. Right now it’s just what I had before, but I’m hoping that actually have a _place_ for them will help to movtivate me. Note that I still need to do some cleanup; the entry titles are just the filenames, which were generated by Gallery (way back when). Of course, cleanup isn’t nearly as fun as creation, so it’ll be a while.
