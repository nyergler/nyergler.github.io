I just saw on the [Python Daily URL][1]  that [ZConfig 2.0][2]  is out. I migrated our internal backup software to ZConfig from Python’s included [ConfigParser][3]  over the summer after cursing one too many times at it’s inability to do intelligent type checking. While it was a pain in the ass to create the schema and grok the datatypes set up, it was well worth it. Finally, config files you can actually read!
