I was [on campus][1]  last night and checked my e-mail between classes. One message was a [ccValidator][2]  bug report, which contained a link to a result page. Since I use Linux at work and Linux/Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X at home, I’d never actually seen my page in Internet Explorer. So I freely confess: the ccValidator results are damn ugly. I’ll have to do something about that.
