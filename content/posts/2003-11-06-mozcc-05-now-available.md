Testers, start your engines. Iâ€™ve just uploaded mozCC 0.5. mozCC is a Mozilla Firebird extension which groks Creative Commons licenses. You can find information about mozCC [here][1] . At this point it mostly works; see the project page for full details. Bug reports, suggestions and feedback are not only welcome but desired.
