I’ve built a new [XPI][1]  for [MozCC][2]  which incorporates fixes for some of the bugs reported to me last week. In particular this release handles some cosmetic bugs. Changes include:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    status bar icons change as appropriate when you switch between tabs
  </li>
  <li>
    the details tree is expanded by default
  </li>
  <li>
    the details tree actually has a title bar on Mac OS X
  </li>
  <li>
    simple layout fixes to the details dialog
  </li>
</ul>

I still have a handful of bugs that need fixed, including the creation of new icons for the status bar. If you’re interested in helping with that, email me and I’ll let you know what’s needed. As always, feedback, comments, bug reports and criticism welcome.
