I’ve released another incremental upgrade to mozCC. You can find out [more about mozCC here][1] . This release (0.5.3) contains the following fixes/improvements:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    the toolbar icon is added to the toolbar by default now (previously you had to customize the toolbar manually)
  </li>
  <li>
    the toolbar icon is greyed out when the page contains no license information
  </li>
  <li>
    the status bar icons have been recreated at 20×20 pixels, so they should appear cleaner
  </li>
  <li>
    Public Domain licenses are now detected properly
  </li>
</ul>

The following items still need attention:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    URIs in the details window should be clickable (anyone who knows how to embed things in XULs &#8216;s should email me. Please.)
  </li>
</ul>

I’m also hoping to add compatibility with the Mozilla Suite. Anyway, give it a try and let me know how you like it (or don’t). The [xpi is here][2] .
