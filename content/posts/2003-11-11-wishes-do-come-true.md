Previously I wrote about my [Mozilla wishlist][1] . Apparently I spoke to soon on at least one count. While examining what it would take to adapt mozCC to support the [Mozilla Suite][2] , I ran across the [DOM Inspector][3] . The DOM Inspector is exactly what I asked for in the second point of my previous post: a way to dynamically examine how a document is constructed. And it ships with Mozilla by default! Iâ€™ve used Firebird for so long I guess I never thought to look at the Tools menu in Mozilla itself. As a beginning XUL developer I already see how useful this is. Examining and grepping the source works, but this lets you zero in on the piece you want to extend. Cool.

Now, about that event monitor...
