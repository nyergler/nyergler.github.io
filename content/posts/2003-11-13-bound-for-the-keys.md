I had hoped to fix some bugs relating to the new Mozilla Firebird Pinstripe theme in mozCC tonite, but it was not to be. After some television and packing, it’s late and we have an early flight.

By this time tomorrow I’ll be basking in the ocean breeze in Key West. It’s only a weekend trip, but it’ll be good to get away. Considering that Indiana is currently very, very cold and very, very windy, highs in the mid-80’s sounds like heaven.

So no updates to the blog, the projects or anything for 4 days. I’ll tell you all about it when I return.
