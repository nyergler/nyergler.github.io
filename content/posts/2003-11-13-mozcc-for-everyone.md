Since announcing mozCC on [Freshmeat][1]  yesterday the response has been amazing. I’ve received some positive feedback (thanks) and some bug reports and suggestions (double thanks). With that in mind, I’ve gone ahead and cut a new release from [cvs][2] .

[mozCC 0.6.1][3]  is out, with improved support for Mozilla Suite and Netscape, some minor cosmetic fixes and new psuedo-autolinking in the details tree. Things that look like links are now underlined in red; double-clicking them will open a new browser window with the link.

Also, the text-only website is gone. [mozCC][3]  has a new home, now with fancy <span class="caps">CSS</span> and real graphics all around. Of course, this means my website looks even worse when compared to this supposedly side-line project. Oh well. Download the new release and let me know what you think.
