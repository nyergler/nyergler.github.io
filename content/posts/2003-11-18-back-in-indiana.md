I made it back to Indiana last night after an absolutely hellish day of travel. I’ll write more about it later, but suffice to say Key West was amazing. We went snorkeling in the Atlantic, walked all over the place, and for an entire weekend completely relaxed (well, as completely as I can). We’ll definitly be going back.

I received quite a few bug reports and questions regarding mozCC while I was gone. Yes, I have them, and I’ll try to work through them and get back to each of you as soon as possible. I’ve also applied for a [MozDev][1]  project in order to provide anonymous <span class="caps">CVS</span> checkouts, Bugzilla and mailing lists. Hopefully I’ll have that up and running in the near future.
