While I was gone there were a handful of bug reports for mozCC (that I still haven’t gotten to). While not a ton, they were enough to convince me that I needed some way to track bugs, etc, while I worked on them. With that in mind, I’ve made some infrastructure changes.

First and foremost I’ve registered and started a [mozCC project][1]  on [mozDev][2] . While I’m still calling yergler.net the “official” site of mozCC, I’ll be using mozDev to handle the new [mailing list][3] , [bug tracking][4]  and [<span class="caps">CVS</span>][5] . These are all things that mozDev does better than I can, so it makes sense. I’ll be moving the <span class="caps">CVS</span> tree over later today, so that change is not yet in effect.

So what does this mean? You can now directly submit bugs. You can subscribe to the mailing list to receive announcements. You can perform anonymous <span class="caps">CVS</span> checkouts (once I move the tree). In short, life should be better for mozCC development.
