I’ve finished moving the CVS repository from my server to mozCC. You can find the [details here][1] . You can now do anonymous checkouts, which was something I felt an open source project needed. This completes the resource move to [MozDev][2] . I’m sure there’s some content changes that need made, and I’ll get to those as I have time. Remember that while CVS and Bugzilla are hosted at MozDev, the freshest, [most up to date information is here][3] , on yergler.net.
