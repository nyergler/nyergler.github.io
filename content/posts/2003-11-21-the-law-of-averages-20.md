After doing the design for the [mozCC website][1] , I decided that The Law of Averages needed an overhaul, too. Just in time for my birthday, here it is; at least it’s first iteration. I know there are still some layout bugs when viewed with Safari, but I’ll get those worked out. In the mean time, let me know how you like it (or don’t). But remember, I’m not a designer, and I don’t play on one television.

**<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>**: I think the layout bugs in Safari have been fixed. Damn style sheet.
