While doing my morning surfing I ran into two very cool items which I don’t presently have a use for. But I want to.

First, Ryan Wilcox [writes][1]  about [PyObj-C][2] , the Python-Objective C bridge for Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X. I’ve seen this mentioned before, but Ryan has a good post that makes me want to try it out. And I would, if not for some nagging belief that programs should work. Anywhere. I mean, I love my Mac. I love developing software on it, and I love the fit and feel of it. But if I write some software, I’d like to be able to share it with my unenlightened friends running Windows, and I’d like to be able to use it at work where I run [Linux][3] . I suppose there are some things that I’d be happy to have as Mac only, I just haven’t come up with a good one yet. But when I do, PyObj-C, here I come.

Second, an addition to the already excellent [Eclipse Project][4] , the [Visual Editor project][5]  brings <span class="caps">GUI</span> building to Eclipse. I don’t do much with Java, and wouldn’t know if at all if not for the fact that most of my Computer Science courses use it. I guess I’ve developed a grudging respect for it. It’ll do in a pinch. When Python’s not available. We’re required to use Borland JBuilder for class. JBuilder is possibly the worst <span class="caps">IDE</span> I’ve used. It definitly doesn’t meet my expectations for Borland tools, which are based on years of Turbo Pascal and Delphi use. But it did do Swing <span class="caps">GUI</span>’s, so I couldn’t recommend Eclipse to my professors. With the addition of <span class="caps">VEP</span>, though, Eclipse is now the clear reigning Java <span class="caps">IDE</span> in my book (don’t even mention NetBeans, please). Now if I only had a Java project to use it on…what am I saying? Wishing for a Java project? I have to go lie down.
