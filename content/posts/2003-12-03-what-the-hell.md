Ok, I love <span class="caps">MIT</span>’s [OpenCourseware][1]  initiative. I think it’s a cool idea and a great contribution to the commons (my words, not theirs). But [this post][2]  to Phillip Greenspun’s blog just pisses me off. In the words of Jill Sobule, “why are all our heros so imperfect?”

For your enjoyment, and apologies to [Nina Totenberg][3]:

_Question_: Why did you choose Microsoft Content Management Server? _Answer_: We read a Gartner Group report that said the Microsoft system was the simplest to use among the commercial vendors and that open-source toolkits weren’t worth considering.

_Question_: Who did the coding and development for you? _Answer_: Why cheap-ass coders in India, of course. (paraphrased)

Sigh.
