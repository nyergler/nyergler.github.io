While of questionable interest to many of you, I’m still pleased to announce that the first public release of WordCited has made it out the door. [WordCited][1]  is a plugin for Microsoft Word which allows you to create <span class="caps">MLA</span> Works Cited (nay, Bibliography) entries with a minimum amount of pain. You can find all the pertinent information at wordcited.com. Yes, it’s written in Visual Basic. I’m not proud of that. But it is Open Source. If you write academic papers, or just need to cite your sources, I think WordCited will help you out.
