So the [Atom 0.3 Spec][1]  is out. For those of you not following the action, Atom is a community driven syndication format proposed as an alternative (nay, better) to <span class="caps">RSS</span>. Mark Pilgrim [blogged][2]  the release with lots of relevant links. Also check out the presentation [Atom In Depth][3]  given at <span class="caps">XML</span> 2003 by [Sam Ruby][4] . Oh, and yergler.net is now [Atomic][5] .
