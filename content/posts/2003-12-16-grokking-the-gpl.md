[Groklaw][1]  has published an excellent [explanation][2]  of just what the GPL is and is not. And why we don’t want your stinkin’ proprietary code. Groklaw continues to amaze me with the consistent clarity and accessibility it maintains while explaining concepts that aren’t always clear to me. Thanks, Groklaw!
