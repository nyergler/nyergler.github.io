This week, under the stress of finals and the holidays, I finally cracked. I
became one of “those people.” By “those people” I mean the ones who treat their
pets like children, feign offense when some refers to them as “just a dog” and
dress them in the canine version of whatever Gucci puts on the runway that
season. [|image0|][1]

OK, so I haven’t succumbed quite that far, but we did take the “kids”, Madeline
and Bosco, to get their picture taken with Santa Claus. Overall, I think they
were a little underwhelmed; after all, my dad gives them much more attention and
doesn’t wear a creepy red velour suit. But it was for a [good cause][2] . Or so
I keep telling myself.
