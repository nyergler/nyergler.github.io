[ccRdf][1]  is now available for [download][2] . This release fixes several bugs related to the getAll and getFirst methods of the rdfDict class. There have also been minor internal implementation changes made.

In addition to bug fixes, I want to note a change in functionality. In previous versions, casting a rdfDict to a string returned itâ€™s <span class="caps">RDF</span> subject. This is **no longer the case**. _str_ now returns a contrived string representation of the current instance, based (very) loosely on the [Dublin Core Dumb-down Algorithm][3] . If someone has a suggestion or better implementation, I welcome it. You can still access the <span class="caps">RDF</span> subject using the subject attribute or the new about method.
