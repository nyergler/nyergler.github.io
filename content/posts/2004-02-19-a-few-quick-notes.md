<span class="caps">OK</span>, I’m sort of busy with school right now, but I’ve had some questions and wanted to post a brief update.

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    <strong>ccValidator</strong>: New release, coming soon: better (more) error reporting, with more informative error messages (hopefully).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>mozCC</strong>: oh-eight-oh development is well under way; stay tuned for a reworked details <span class="caps">UI</span>, preliminary support for foaf:tipjar and much more. Note to all you <span class="caps">HIG</span> fanatics out there: yes, I’ve been properly thrashed; yes, I’m fixing things. Move along.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>quickFile</strong>: no, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yergler.net/averages/archives/2003/12/14/filing_mail_in_thunderbird">it’s</a> not dead yet; in fact, a release that actually works should be rolling out within the week.
  </li>
  <li>
    and finally, stayed tuned for the epic battle of installing <a class="reference external" href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/">Sarge</a> onto an <a class="reference external" href="http://global.acer.com/products/tablet_pc/tmc100.htm">Acer Travelmate Tablet</a>. It’s bloody and gory, but you won’t want to miss it.
