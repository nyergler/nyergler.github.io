As promised yesterday, I’ve updated [ccValidator][1]  with a minor update. The source, as always, is available in the [release archive][2] . This release exposes some validation errors which were previously masked as _“unknown errors”_. These updates provide more verbose error reporting in instances where the RDF is well-formed XML, but not properly structured RDF.

Comments, criticism and suggestions are [welcome][3] , as always.
