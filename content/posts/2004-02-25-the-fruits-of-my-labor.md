[|image0|][1]  Weeks after purchasing and [installing the wood working equipment][2]  in my basement (which was generally dubbed “out of character” to say the least), I have something to show for. Now when people ask why I need a table saw, and I respond “So I can make a picture frame,” I’m serious. Here it is, holding my Tori concert placard. Now that that’s done I can let those tools sit in good conscience.
