Iâ€™ve just updated the QuickFile <span class="caps">XPI</span> with a handful of bug fixes and improvements. QuickFile is an extension for [Mozilla Thunderbird][1]  which enables keyboard-only message filing.

The most notable improvment in this release is the ability to assign the hot-key which begins the filing process. You can find more about [QuickFile here][2]  and download and [installation information is here][3] .

Future releases will feature folder-specific hotkeys and filing target suggestions (based on previous filing behavior). Feedback, bug reports and suggestions are welcome.
