Not two hours after announcing QuickFile 0.0.2, Dennis of Heidelburg, Germany, emailed me with a bug report. Of course, when I say bug, I mean “the core functionality doesn’t work.” Oops. For some reason Thunderbird on Linux doesn’t seem to care if you call an `int` a `char`. Mac OS X and Win32 do. The bug’s been fixed, and the [XPI][1]  updated. Thanks, Dennis!
