Not two hours after announcing QuickFile 0.0.2, Dennis of Heidelburg, Germany, emailed me with a bug report. Of course, when I say bug, I mean “the core functionality doesn’t work.” Oops. For some reason Thunderbird on Linux doesn’t seem to care if you call an <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> a <tt class="docutils literal">char</tt>. Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X and Win32 do. The bug’s been fixed, and the [<span class="caps">XPI</span>][1]  updated. Thanks, Dennis!
