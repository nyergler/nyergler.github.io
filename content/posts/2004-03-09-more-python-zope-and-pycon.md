So things on the MozCC/QuickFile/cc-oasis front will be quiet for a while as I’m gearing up for PyCon. As part of that I’m also getting ready for the [Zope3 Sprint][1]  which is happening a few days beforehand. I took part last year, learned a lot, and am looking forward to it again. So just a few quick highlights of what I’m working on now:

* [Zope Product Tutorial][2]  a short tutorial on developing a <span class="caps">CMF</span>-aware Zope product

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://tech.canterburyschool.org/tech/PyCon_2004">Developing Web-based Classroom Tools with Zope</a>, a definite work in progress
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://tech.canterburyschool.org/tech/CMFOOo">Zope <span class="caps">CMF</span> support for OpenOffice.org</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/FrontPage">Zope3 Project</a>, the big change in Zope; I’m working on developing a proof-of-concept port of <a class="reference external" href="http://tech.canterburyschool.org/tech/STOA">Stoa</a> to the new architecture
  </li>
</ul>
