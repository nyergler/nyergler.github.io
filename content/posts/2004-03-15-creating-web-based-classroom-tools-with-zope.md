As previously mentioned, my colleague Vern and I will be presenting at [PyCon][1]  in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span> next week. We’ve just completed our paper, [Creating Web-based Classroom Tools with Zope][2] . You can find it in the [Canterbury School Tech Department][3]  wiki. We’ll have slides soon, too.

As part of my preparations for both PyCon and the Zope 3 sprint, I’ve written two tutorials covering the same material: one for Zope 2.x, one for Zope 3. You can find them in the wiki, too:

* [Creating a Zope <span class="caps">CMF</span> product][4]  (Zope 2.x) * [Creating a Zope 3 Product][5]

The Zope 3 tutorial was written mostly as a way to help me remember the core differences between Zope 2 and Zope 3. They are plentiful, and they make life much, much better.
