Well we made it to <span class="caps">DC</span> with minimal trouble. Apparently all Continental Airlines filght attendants are trained to be mildly amusing. Example: “I’ll now dim the cabin lights for you comfort and to enhance the appearance of your attendant.” Really, sweetheart, they don’t dim that far.

The [PyCon Sprints][1]  start today, although the Zope 3 sprint I’m participating in doesn’t officially start until tomorrow. Other Zopetistas are supposedly showing up a little later this morning so maybe some on-subject hacking will actually occur.

The plan, in theory, is to blog PyCon 04 aggressivly; I’m not sure why, but it seems like an interesting journalistic and archival exercise to record what goes one. And the [slate of talks][2]  looks better and more focused than last year. Should be an interesting week.
