Yesterday was a marathon session, with Stephan and I hacking the [browser:tool][1]  from 10AM until nearly 8PM. The good news is that we’re feature complete, with tests and everything. The bad news is we realized this morning that we forgot to internationalize the code. Sigh. The amount of infrastructure that Zope 3 provides is amazing, and in a huge improvment from Zope 2, it’s actually a rational API.

Today we start the sprint full force. The neophytes have seen the tutorial, and we’re going to take a look at the TODO list once everyone arrives. We’ll see what we tackle today; hopefully we’re as productive as we’ve been the past two days.
