So I’ve made it through to finals week, once again taking 9 hours of classes on top of working full time. I think I [said][1]  I’d never do that again, but it really wasn’t so bad this semester. I e-mailed in my take home final in Computer Organization and Architecture last night, and I take my Politics of the European Union final on Wednesday evening, so I have plenty of opportunity to prepare.

My third class, Visual Communication, has been one of the most enjoyable I’ve taken. I signed up not knowing what it would entail, simply needing to fill an elective requirement. It turns out that Visual Communication is really Photojournalism, and since I’d never actually used a 35mm camera, it was all new to me. We spent the first half of the semester shooting black and white [Kodak Tri-X][2]  and learning to process and print our own images. The second half was spent shooting color film and manipulating the images in Photoshop. After the first class I went to Sunny Schick’s, a local camera shop, to find a used camera. The old man wasn’t lying when he said, “you just wait; there’s nothing quite like seeing an image appear on paper and knowing that you captured it.” I bought a used [Pentax Spotmatic][3]  that’s probably older than I am. Fully manual, without even a hot-shoe, it evokes a visceral pleasure every time I press the shutter release. I’ve since purchased a [Minolta Maxxum 70][4] , but I still shoot with the Spotmatic because it seems more immediate and precise.

So what started out as a requirement filler has turned into something I’ve really enjoyed and want to continue working with. I’ve gone from an [unfulfilled desire][5]  to capture images to learning to look through the camera and see what I’ll get. And I’ve gone from complete ignorance to an addiction to [photo.net][6]  and talk of F-stops and aperture. This is what an education should do: it should inspire us to think about things differently and notice what’s going on in our lives. Needless to say, I’m glad I took this class. Now where am I gonna put my darkroom?
