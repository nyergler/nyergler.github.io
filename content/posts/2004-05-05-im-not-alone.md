In the “funny you should mention it” category, I just came across proof that [I’m][1]  not the only one who [has a problem with bookmarks][2]  or who [wants to do something about it][3] . Actually Micah wants something a little more generic, but I think the impetus is the same: sticky notes, notes in the margin and paper napkins with scrawls on them just shouldn’t be our primary means of keeping track of things. Well that’s gratifying.
