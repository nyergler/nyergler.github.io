As I mentioned [earlier][1] , the proliferation of spam comments and the flap over [Movable Type’s][2]  new licensing scheme motivated me to search out other blogging software. As I looked around, my two favorites were [TextPattern][3]  and [WordPress][4] . Given the title of this post, you can probably guess which one I chose.

It took me a couple hours this morning, but I managed to wrangle my <span class="caps">MT</span> entries into WordPress, and even got my templates mostly working. I initially evaluated <span class="caps">WP</span> 1.02, the latest release, but decided to live on the edge and actually use the current release candidate of 1.2. Overall, it’s very impressive. What have I gained over Movable Type?

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    an improved, stream-lined editting interface that doesn’t require multiple windows for assigning more than one category
  </li>
  <li>
    a template system that doesn’t rely on magic tags, but rather exploits the power of the underlying language (in this case <span class="caps">PHP</span>); this might not seem like a lot, but it’s allowed me to recreate parts of <span class="caps">MT</span> that WordPress doesn’t provide an interface for (like template “blocks”)
  </li>
  <li>
    templates that live on the filesystem, which makes editting and back up a lot easier
  </li>
  <li>
    oh yeah, and it’s really, really Free. <a class="reference external" href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a> has an excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">post</a> on this very subject, and when smart people agree with me, I feel better.
  </li>
</ul>

So why not TextPattern? I have to admit, I was initially drawn to the clean lines and good looks of it’s user interface. Yet somehow, even after reading the license and seeing that it allowed redistribution, I didn’t feel good about it. And then I read [this page][5]  in the TextPattern forum, and realized that if I chose <span class="caps">TP</span>, it’d be <span class="caps">MT</span> all over again: free enough for now, not free enough forever.
