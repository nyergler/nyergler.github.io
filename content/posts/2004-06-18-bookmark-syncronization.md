[Andy][1]  pointed out that someone developed a Firefox extension which allows you to [syncronize your bookmarks][2]  across multiple machines/platforms. While not exactly what I had in mind, this is definitly a good start towards my desire for [better bookmarks][3] .

In addition to the extension, I also found an [article][4]  on [IDEAlog][5]  that discusses the properties Internet-aware applications (such as the one I envision) should have. An interesting read that has me thinking again about what I can do to improve my browsing experience.
