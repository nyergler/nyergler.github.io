I’ve uploaded an update to my [Java experiment][1] , [ccSaver][2] . The 0.2 release adds some features, er, necessities, for actual usage. Such as an error message if it’s unable to download an image (instead of a stack trace and spectacular <span class="caps">JVM</span> crash), and actually paying attention to configuration settings. Additionally, 0.2 lowers the bar for Windows installation by only requiring a [<span class="caps">JRE</span> 1.4][3]  installation (0.1 required a 1.5 beta).

Anyway, give it a [try][4]  and let me know what you think.
