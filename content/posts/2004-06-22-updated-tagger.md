Just a quick note that Iâ€™ve uploaded new builds of ccTag, a set of graphical and command-line tools for embedding [Creative Commons][1]  license claims in <span class="caps">MP3</span> files. Builds are available for Win32 and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X; the source is available as a tarball. This build corrects a problem with the Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X builds which caused ccTag to crash in a rather disappointing way. [Go][2]  and check it out.
