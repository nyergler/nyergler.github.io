Yesterday afternoon Garrett and I officially became domestic partners, if not in the eyes of the law, then in the eyes of [Purdue University][1] , his employer. With my impending job transition, I’m hopping onto his benefits package. For this to happen we were required to sign an affadavit and have it notarized. So yesterday, at 4:10p.m., with our bank’s notary Sara acting as a witness, we signed. As we walked out Garrett commented, “so, I guess we’re married now, huh?” Yeah; I guess so. Funny, I always hoped there’d be more [kitchen appliances][2]  foisted on us when this happened.
