![The Queen has Spoken][1]

Garrett and I spent last weekend in Toronto for Toronto Pride. A “quick” 7 hour drive from Fort Wayne, it was actually a nice little get away. During that time, we decided that Canada (well, maybe just Toronto) really is paradise. Why? Five simple reasons:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    Legalized gay marriage
  </li>
  <li>
    Socialized health care
  </li>
  <li>
    No smoking in bars and restaurants
  </li>
  <li>
    They say “line up” instead of “queue” or “line” (<span class="caps">OK</span>, so it may not be paradise, but it is cute)
  </li>
  <li>
    No George W. Bush (and seemingly no one who really likes him, but it may have been the company we were keeping)
  </li>
</ul>

Anyway, you can check out the photos I shot of the parade [here][2] .
