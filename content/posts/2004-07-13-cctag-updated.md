Iâ€™ve updated [ccTag][1] , the graphical interface for [tagging][2]  audio files with [Creative Commons][3]  licenses. Ironically, the updates are all command-line: 0.5.5 includes a new tool, ccl, which takes an audio file and verifies the license embedded in it. [Try it out][4] , and look for the feature to get a graphical interface in the next release.
