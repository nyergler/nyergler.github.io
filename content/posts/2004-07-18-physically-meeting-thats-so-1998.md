Iâ€™m in San Francisco for the next week. I arrived around noon, and spent the afternoon wandering around the city. Itâ€™s been about 18 months since I was here last, but it always seems like I fall back into the rythym of the city. True, Iâ€™m still anxious about new places and a little agoraphobic when it comes to places Iâ€™m unfamiliar with, but in San Francisco the anxiety and nervousness is a familiar, almost comforting part off the background noise.

Iâ€™m here to meet the [Creative Commons][1]  staff, and get plugged in to the organization. Itâ€™s a little daunting, actually. The entire interview, negotiation and contract process was done via e-mail, and prior to July 1 I had only spoken to [Mike][2]  once, when I started contracting for [ccTag][3] . Iâ€™m a little intimidated, but mostly Iâ€™m incredibly excited. So far this job has been a great experience, and itâ€™ll be cool to finally put faces with the names and voices Iâ€™ve been interacting with in conference calls over the past couple of weeks.

Iâ€™m here in San Francisco through Saturday, at which point Iâ€™m heading up to Portland for a little mini-vacation. Of course, what would vacation be without work? ðŸ˜‰ Iâ€™ll be attending [<span class="caps">OSCON</span>][4]  along with two days of tutorials. Itâ€™s interesting how lifeâ€™s events are so interconnected: two years ago I attended <span class="caps">OSCON</span> in San Diego. I was just over a year into my job at Canterbury, had found open source religion, but wasnâ€™t really plugged into the ideas. I heard Lessig speak, and that marked the start of my fascination with Creative Commons. Now, two years later, Iâ€™m spending a week at the <span class="caps">CC</span> offices before heading to <span class="caps">OSCON</span> again.
