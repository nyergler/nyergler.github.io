mozCC 0.8.3 has been released, and all users of mozCC are encouraged to upgrade. mozCC 0.8.3 is a bug fix release which corrects conditions which caused Mozilla and Firefox to lock-up when certain license combinations were encountered. Pages impacted by this bug include the [Creative Commons][2]  [license selection][3]  process.

Firefox users can seamlessly upgrade by going to the Extension Manager, clicking on mozCC, and then clicking the Check for Updates button. The XPI can be found in the [release archive][4] .

As always, comments, feedback and bug reports are welcome. Send them to <mozcc@yergler.net> .
