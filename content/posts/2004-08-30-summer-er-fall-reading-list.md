I go into every summer (actually every “break,” be it summer, christmas, etc) thinking I’m going to catch up on my reading. It hasn’t happened yet. So I just finished Joe Trippi’s excellent “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” It reminded me how exciting it is to be young (hey, I am, relatively!) and engaged in changing culture and society. So here’s my current reading list (that is, things I’ve purchased, and have yet to read):

\* “We the Media”, Dan Gillmor (in progress) \* “The Anarchist in the Library”, Siva Vaidhyanathan (in progress) \* “Copyright in Historical Perspective”, Lyman Ray Patterson \* “Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid”, Douglas R. Hofstadter \* “A Hope in the Unseen”, Ron Suskind \* “Fast Food Nation”, Eric Scholsser \* “Personal History”, Katharine Graham \* “The Rise of the Creative Class”, Richard Florida

Last night we were killing time in Barnes & Noble before our movie began, and I had to resist the temptation to add to the pile. Is this an addiction?
