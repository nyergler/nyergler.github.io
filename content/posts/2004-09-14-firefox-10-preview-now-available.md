[Mozillazine][1]  reports that [mozilla.org][2]  has released the Firefox 1.0 Preview Release. I just downloaded the Windows version and can report a few things:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    First, there is <strong>no</strong> reason to use Internet Explorer. Ever. Firefox on Windows is fast, intuitive and pretty. What’s more, if you don’t like how it works, or want some additional functionality, you can <a class="reference external" href="http://update.mozilla.org">do something about it</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Second, <a class="reference external" href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc">mozCC</a> works great with the preview release. Go on, install it, give it a try and <a class="reference external" href="/contact">let me know</a> if you run into any problems.
  </li>
</ul>
