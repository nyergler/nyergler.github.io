[Patrick Roberts][1] , author of the [Python and wxPython-based] news aggregator [egoClip][2]  has written a generalized exception handling module for wxPython which traps Python exceptions and POSTs details to an arbitrary (well, developer determined) <span class="caps">URL</span>. The module, [wxSupportWiz][3] , is available as source [here][4] . I haven’t tried it yet, but it seems like a good idea, and one I’ll be wrapping into ccTag as work progresses.

One possible improvment might be to allow the user to comment on what they were doing or what they were trying to do. We’ll see how it works.
