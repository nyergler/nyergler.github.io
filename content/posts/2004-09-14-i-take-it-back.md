I take [it][1]  back. Yes, Camino is faster than Firefox 0.9.3. However, I just downloaded Firefox 1.0 Preview Release, and (excuse my, er, French) Holy Fuck (or is that Fuque?). I know it’s not scientific, but the Firefox 1.0 Preview Release starts in a single Dock “bounce,” compared with 2 for Camino 0.8.1, and 4 for 0.9.3. If this is any sort of preview of things to come in the **real** 1.0 release, Firefox will (does) crush the [competition][2] . It hardly seems fair.

Now, what can be done about Thunderbird’s abysmal startup speed? Anybody? Anybody?
