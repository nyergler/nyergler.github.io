After being under the weather yesterday, I’m feeling better today. Which is a good thing, because there’s lots to be done. Tuesday is [the concert][1]  in New York City, and I’m leaving Indiana this evening. I’ve never been to <span class="caps">NYC</span>, and before the gay police come and take my membership card, I figure I need a weekend in the city.

So here’s the plan: get into New York late tonite, explore the city tomorrow and maybe take in a show and nightlife. Sunday, more exploring, more shopping. Monday and Tuesday, <span class="caps">CC</span> stuff for me, god knows what for Garrett (I’m guessing shopping). And Tuesday, drinks and a concert. All that, and back in time for class on Wednesday.
