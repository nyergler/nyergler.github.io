Last night’s [concert][1]  was absoluting amazing. Byrne and Gil both did amazing sets, and even did a couple of songs together. In particular I liked Byrne’s rendition of “Once In a Lifetime.” And the after party was cool, too. <span class="caps">OK</span>, so I spent most of it feeling completely out of place, but I did get the chance to chat with Mike and Matt for a while. Oh, and who would have thought that I’d be able to say, “[David Byrne][2] ? Yeah, I had a drink with him.” And by “with him” I mean we ordered a drink at the bar at roughly the same time, and I got the knowing-nod.

There was, of course, the incredibly weird conversation with Drunken-Latin-Cute-Guy:

> **<span class="caps">DLCG</span>:**So, you work for Wired? **<span class="caps">NRY</span>:**No, I work for <span class="caps">CC</span>. **<span class="caps">DLCG</span>:**What do you do at Wired? **<span class="caps">NRY</span>:**Actually, I don’t work for Wired; I work for the Creative Commons, writing software. **<span class="caps">DLCG</span>:**Oh, cool; so you’re a genius, huh? **<span class="caps">NRY</span>:**No, just lucky, I guess. **<span class="caps">DLCG</span>:**So do you only write about software and technology for Wired, or do you write about other shit, too? **<span class="caps">NRY</span>:**[smiling to say “you’re an idiot”]No, I just write about software. Enjoy your drink.<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
