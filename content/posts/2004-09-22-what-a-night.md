Last night’s [concert][1]  was absoluting amazing. Byrne and Gil both did amazing sets, and even did a couple of songs together. In particular I liked Byrne’s rendition of “Once In a Lifetime.” And the after party was cool, too. OK, so I spent most of it feeling completely out of place, but I did get the chance to chat with Mike and Matt for a while. Oh, and who would have thought that I’d be able to say, “[David Byrne][2] ? Yeah, I had a drink with him.” And by “with him” I mean we ordered a drink at the bar at roughly the same time, and I got the knowing-nod.

There was, of course, the incredibly weird conversation with Drunken-Latin-Cute-Guy:

> **DLCG:**So, you work for Wired? **NRY:**No, I work for CC. **DLCG:**What do you do at Wired? **NRY:**Actually, I don’t work for Wired; I work for the Creative Commons, writing software. **DLCG:**Oh, cool; so you’re a genius, huh? **NRY:**No, just lucky, I guess. **DLCG:**So do you only write about software and technology for Wired, or do you write about other shit, too? **NRY:**[smiling to say “you’re an idiot”]No, I just write about software. Enjoy your drink.
