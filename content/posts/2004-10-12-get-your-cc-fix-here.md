For all you Mac OS X users who can’t get enough [Creative Commons][1]  licensed content, your fix has arrived: a [CC search][2]  plugin for [Sherlock][3] .

<div class="figure">
  <img alt="" src="http://yergler.net/blog/images/ccsherlock_thumb.png" />

  <p class="caption">
    (cc search for text documents containing &#8216;yergler'; <a class="reference external" href="http://yergler.net/blog/images/ccsherlock.png">full size</a>)
  </p>
</div>

You can open the channel at <sherlock://drop.creativecommons.org/sherlock/ccsearch.xml> .

There are still some improvements to be made, like display of the license icons in the search results, but that’ll have to wait. If you have suggestions or feedback, [let me know][4] . I’ll make the source code available and blog about the actual development process a little later. Enjoy!
