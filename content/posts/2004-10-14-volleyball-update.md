As I’ve reported before, Garrett and I play volleyball in a [city league][1] . Our team, the ironically named “Hot Shots”, has historically embodied the idea of a recreational league: little to no talent, and booze after losses. “Seasons” run 8 weeks and last season we won, uh, 3 games out of 32. You get the idea.

The new indoor season started last week, and we have new people on our team. And last night, we won, not 1, but **3** games out of 4, including 1 win against a much more talented team (which has historically crushed us). To quote [Office Space][2] , “Fuckin’ A!”
