[Dogpoet][1]  (whom I have envied from afar for picking up and moving to NYC) [makes an interesting comment][2]  about his new life in NYC.

> In some ways it was a relief to finally admit this to myself, to stop pretending that my “new life” was one exciting thing after another, rather than admitting the truth; that my new life was an exhausting, overwhelming, homesick-inducing series of days and that, for as seldom as I left campus, I might as well be in Houston.
Some days I feel the same way about the changes going on in my life. Admittedly, leaving [Canterbury][3]  to work for [Creative Commons][4]  isn’t the change that moving from the west to east coasts is, but it was a big deal to me. And while I appreciate everyone who expresses how happy and excited they are for me, if I have to hear one more person say “You’re so _lucky_ you get to work from home! Must be _so_ tough!”

Look, I know you mean well, and I know you have no idea what you’re talking about. Yes, I love what I’m doing, and yes, in many ways I have my dream job. That doesn’t mean I don’t miss the social aspects of the office. It doesn’t mean that because I _can_ work in my pajamas that I do, or that if I did I’d do any less work. And just because I work from home doesn’t mean life is perfect or that I don’t take my work seriously.

In short, just because someone makes a move to follow a dream doesn’t mean their life is peaches and cream.
