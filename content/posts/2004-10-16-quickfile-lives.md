Despite rumors of it’s demise, [QuickFile][1]  lives on. QuickFile is an extension for Mozilla Thunderbird which enables message filing using only the keyboard interface. [QuickFile 0.0.3][2]  (release archive [here][3]  is a maintenance release that adds support for Thunderbird 0.8 and the new extension update system shared by Thunderbird and Firefox.

So what’s next? Folder hot keys and “predictive” folder selection. Stay tuned.
