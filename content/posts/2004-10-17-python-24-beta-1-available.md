Beta 1 of the next version of everyone’s favorite language, Python, is now available. While most of the syntactic aren’t earth-shattering (for me), some of the module changes are. For example, the <span class="caps">CJK</span> Codecs package used in [ccValidator][1]  are now part of the standard library, meaning one less external dependency to track. Strings have also gained an &#8216;rsplit’ method, meaning no more &#8216;astring.split()[-1]’, a hack I always had trouble defending.

Check out [What’s New in 2.4][2]  for all the details, or download [here][3] .
