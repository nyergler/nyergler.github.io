You know, [Matt’s][1]  [right][2]  ; PayPal really is for the lazy. And while I’m a whole-hearted supporter of laziness and sloth in general, PayPal isn’t getting any more of my business.

The [Washington Blade][3]  [reports][4]  that PayPal is using their new “anti-porn” terms of service to [terminate service][5]  to online publisher of gay-themed books, as well as an [organization][6]  fighting <span class="caps">AIDS</span> through music and culture. Hardly hard core, if you ask me. Ignoring for a moment the question of whether or not PayPal should take a position on such an irrelevant issue, does anyone know of any “straight” businesses which have been dropped for such petty reasons?
