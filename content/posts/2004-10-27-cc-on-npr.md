[NPR’s][1]  [Talk of the Nation][2]  featured an interview this afternoon with WIRED editor-in-chief Chris Anderson and Le Tigre’s Kathleen Hanna, discussing the WIRED CD. My favorite quote was from Kathleen, when asked what she thought of giving music away, she responded:

> “We give a lot of stuff away for free anyway, so it’s nice to be asked.”
