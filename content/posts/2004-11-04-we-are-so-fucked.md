I’ d like to provide some pithy, insightful commentary on the election, but frankly, I’m in a state of shock(“23% of _my people_ voted for _him_?!?”). I’ve voted for plenty of losers (witness my flirtation with the Libertarian Party), but I’ve never felt so… betrayed. So instead I offer a list of things other bloggers are saying which made me smile. Now go, crank up the [Le Tigre][1] , and kindle the anger and outrage that will last for the next four years.
