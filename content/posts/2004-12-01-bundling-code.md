Mono appeals to me in much the same way as ObectiveC: it _seems_ like I should like it (and have a use for it), but I haven’t identified one yet. While reading [Planet Gnome][1] , I noticed that [Miguel][2]  [blogged][3]  about a new feature in Mono: bundling. That is, wrapping your dependencies in a single, distributable executable. After some, uh, intimate work with Python’s <tt class="docutils literal">distutils</tt>, py2exe and BundleBuilder, explicit and integrated bundling support sounds like heaven.
