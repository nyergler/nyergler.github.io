Bryan, Best Buy may have [redeemed themselves][1]  in your eyes, but they’re still pure evil. Their employees, whether by ignorance or training, can be “considered harmful” to technology consumers who aren’t necessarily that tech savvy.

Consider this exchange: a woman is buying an iPod for her son. Employee: “Well you’ll definitly want the protection plan; the batteries don’t last more than a year, tops, and Apple can take up to two months to replace them, even though you have to pay for it.” Huh, that’s news to me, considering I have an older iPod that’s still going strong. With the original battery.

Or how about this. My sister was considering buying some home theatre equipment, and while a Samsung model fit her price range better, she was concerned about the audio quality compared to the Sony. “Well,” answered the [STRIKEOUT:snake oil salesman] “associate”, “no reason to worry; Sony bought Samsung, so they’re really the same now.”

Thanks, but no; I’d rather support a store which doesn’t out right lie to customers.
