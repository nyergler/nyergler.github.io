Well if you can see this post, the <span class="caps">DNS</span> changes have propogated, and yergler.net has safely arrived at it’s new home. I’ve moved the domain to [TextDrive][1] , and not just because they seem really geeky. More importantly, they have amazing support, really smart people working for them, and Python 2.4 already on their web servers.

Of course, not everything’s quite up to speed yet. The photo albums are offline, as is the <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository. They should both be back real soon now, although <span class="caps">CVS</span> will be converted to Subversion. If you find something seriously amiss, [let me know][2] .
