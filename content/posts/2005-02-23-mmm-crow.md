<span class="caps">OK</span>, I admit it. I have been trained from a very early age to respond to guilt. And so, after [yesterday’s entry][1] , I decided that complaining about [NewsFire][2]  is an indefensible position, especially considering how much I’ve used the application. So this morning I shelled out and registered.

But let me clarify one point: I still feel a little duped. So in the interest of constructive criticism (and so I know what to do in the event **I** actually want to charge for an app), I’ve done some thinking about why. Keep in mind that these reasons are firmly rooted in ignorance: I found [NewsFire][2]  via the [<span class="caps">OS</span> X <span class="caps">RSS</span> Showdown][3] , never really bothered to read much of the background, and still haven’t looked at so much as a <span class="caps">FAQ</span> on the site.

So the two thoughts are:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    When you download the free version, there didn’t seem to be any mention of the restrictions. I’ve noticed this is true of lots of shareware sites. All I want to do is make an informed decision about what I need: a statement of what’s missing, or (even better) a pretty grid comparing “lite” to “full” would make the process much easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    It wasn’t clear to me that the author eventually intended to charge for the application when I downloaded the beta.
  </li>
</ul>

Damn, and here I thought there was something insightful lying around somewhere.
