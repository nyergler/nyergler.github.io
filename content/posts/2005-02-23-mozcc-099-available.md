So I promised a new release of mozCC to users back in December. And it was released… this morning. Right, so you can see the [release announcement][1]  for all the gory details. The cool thing is that this is the 1.0 Release Candidate and we’ve fixed a couple of bugs that were pretty annoying. So update your installation, and get your [feedback][2]  and [bug reports][3]  in so we can get 1.0 out the door.
