Just a short note, for the record, so to speak. [I was there][1] . While I don’t think anyone’s mind was changed, it was really gratifying to see **absolutely no one** from the local community showed up to support Phelps. My favorite moment:

> **Phelps**: &#8230;and this nation is going to HELL, in a fornicator’s handbasket! **Garrett** _(stage wisper)_: Hey, where do I get one of those?!
Also notable was being informed that I’m addicted to (and I really am quoting here) “filthy anal copulation”. Coming soon, Fornicator Handbaskets and “I ♥ Anal Copulation” panties.
