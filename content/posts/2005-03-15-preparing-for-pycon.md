[PyCon 2005][1]  is next week at [<span class="caps">GWU</span>][2]  in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>. The [schedule][3]  was posted online a couple weeks ago, and I’m very impressed with the selection of talks this year. While PyCon has always been informative and interesting, it looks like the quality of talks is going to be consistently good this year. And there’s still time to register at the “regular” rate (before it increases to the “at the door” rate on March 19).

I’m once again presenting, so I’m spending much of my time this week preparing my presentations. I’ve created a [page in my wiki][4]  where I’ll be assembling talk related materials, links, etc. I’m using Eric Meyer’s [S5][5]  this year, which is pretty cool. Now if only I had a simple desktop app for assembling the <span class="caps">XHTML</span>.
