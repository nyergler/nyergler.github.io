As with most trends, I’ve come to Pod-casting late. But it’s totally worth it, as I’ve discovered [7 Second Delay][1] , a weekly radio show from [<span class="caps">WFMU</span>][2] , a “free form radio station” from the New York City area. I’m trying to figure out how to describe it, and frankly, words fail me. Listen, you must.
