I’m in Washington, DC for the remainder of the week for [PyCon 2005][1] . This years’ schedule looks really interesting, and of course I’m presenting tomorrow. Twice. So I’m a little nervous about that.

I’ve posted [updated slides][2]  for my Desktop Apps talk, and I’ll be putting slides for my RDF talk online later today (OK, probably tonite).
