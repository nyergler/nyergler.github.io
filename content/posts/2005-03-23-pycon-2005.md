I’m in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span> for the remainder of the week for [PyCon 2005][1] . This years’ schedule looks really interesting, and of course I’m presenting tomorrow. Twice. So I’m a little nervous about that.

I’ve posted [updated slides][2]  for my Desktop Apps talk, and I’ll be putting slides for my <span class="caps">RDF</span> talk online later today (<span class="caps">OK</span>, probably tonite).
