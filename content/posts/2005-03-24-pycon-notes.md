I just noticed that [Ted Leung][1]  is [once again hosting][2]  PyCon [SubEthaEdit][3]  notes. You can find the [directory here][4] .

In other social editting software news, there was an open space session on “SubEmacsEdit: Developing Social Editting for Emacs” yesterday (seriously, I can’t make this shit up). I wonder what the outcome was.

**UPDATE**: [Here][5]  are the notes from my desktop apps talk. From the looks of things, I guess it went OK.
