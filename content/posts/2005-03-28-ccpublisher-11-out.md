ccPublisher 1.1 is out. Get it [here][1] , or from [Sourceforge][2] .

This is a bug fix release, and fixes the following major bugs:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    ccPublisher crashes when unicode characters are present in metadata
  </li>
  <li>
    ccPublisher crashes under some circumstances when extracting metadata from <span class="caps">MP3</span> files with existing ID3v2.2 tags
  </li>
  <li>
    Media types other than audio and video are now uploaded to the opensource_media collection at the Internet Archive.
  </li>
</ul>

Now back to hacking on the 2.0 framework.
