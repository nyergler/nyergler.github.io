[All Things Considered][1]  had a [story][2]  [yesterday][3]  on [PostSecret][4] , a web site which invites people to send in postcards with their deepest secrets, and have them posted online. Some of the secrets are poignant, and some and a little scary. But what an amazing way to connect people in collaborative art that can actually **move** people.

Oh, and in less interesting news, [mozCC][5]  1.0 is out. I guess I have to remove the bit about it being “pre-release software” now.
