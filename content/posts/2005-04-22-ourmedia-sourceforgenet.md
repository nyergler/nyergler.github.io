I haven’t blogged about this (at all) yet, but I’ve been tangentially involved in the [Ourmedia][1]  project for the past few months. Specifically I’ve been responsible for adapting ccPublisher to Ourmedia Publisher, which is their desktop upload tool. I figure I should announce here that the Ourmedia Publisher source code is now available at Sourceforge in the [Ourmedia Projects][2] .

As we move towards ccPublisher 2, it’s my hope that ccPublisher and Ourmedia Publisher will both become special cases of a more generalized code base, since they share 90% of their backend code.
