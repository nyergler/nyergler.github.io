At the risk of adding to the echo chamber, I’d like to point out the [React Framework for Zope][1] , a Zope 2.x product which attempts to ease web development by “stealing ideas from [Ruby on Rails][2] ”. <span class="caps">OK</span>, so this looks cool. But I can’t help wondering why Rails has become the gold standard that web application frameworks aspire towards? Between React, [Subway][3]  and [CherryPy][4]  (which Subway uses), there seems to be quite a bit of interest in coming up with either “Python on Rails” or a “Rails Killer”. Is Rails really that good? I admit it looks cool, but I haven’t actually used it. Can someone help me out on this?
