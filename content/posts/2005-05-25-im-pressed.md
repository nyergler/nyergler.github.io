I recently blogged about developing a CherryPy application to drive the non-blog portion of yergler.net. Important features (for me) were a clean, web-based admin interface, the ability to organize content into “folders” and the ability to arbitrarily extend the system. After putting together a prototype (which actually worked… mostly), I realized that [WordPress][1]  had added support for sub-page URLs. “Holy crap,” I thought, “Word Press can act as a mini-<span class="caps">CMS</span>, and I’ll get to leverage everything they’ve done [even if it is in <span class="caps">PHP</span>]”. So I did.

You’ll notice that [yergler.net][2]  is now powered by Word Press, along with a handful of plugins and hacks. In the development of the site, I actually did put together my own WordPress plugin, which I’ll hopefully be releasing “real soon now.” Stay tuned.
