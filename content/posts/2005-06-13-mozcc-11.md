mozCC 1.1 is now available for download. This release corrects a few bugs, including:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    license attributes were not displayed correctly on pages which published Work metadata (with a license reference) but no License block
  </li>
  <li>
    pages which contained multiple work elements (including those at, ahem, <a class="reference external" href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>) weren’t displayed correctly
  </li>
  <li>
    some pages incorrectly displayed license elements (such as the “by” icon) multiple times
  </li>
</ul>

This release should be picked up by the Firefox Update Manager. You may also download it directly from the [mozCC install][1]  page.
