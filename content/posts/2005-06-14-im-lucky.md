I’m in San Francisco this week, working at the [<span class="caps">CC</span>][1]  office. I got in on Sunday, and feel more productive than I have in weeks. Today was mostly meetings, and I’m sorta wrung out, but at the same time I have all these ideas in my head that I’m not sure how to translate to action. And I’m in my hotel room, reading [The Believer][2] , listening to [Aimee Mann][3] , and was actually moved to tears by the song “I’ve Had It.” And I realize how fucking amazing creativity is, and how fucking lucky I am to work in service of it.
