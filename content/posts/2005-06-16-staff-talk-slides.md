Tuesday I gave two talks at <span class="caps">CC</span> in San Francisco. The first, [Software for the Commons][1]  is an overview of the software I’ve developed in my year at <span class="caps">CC</span>, and was presented to most of the staff. The second was presented to Mike and our tech interns, Brian and Will, and covered the new [ccPublisher 2 Architecture][2] . Links are to slides.
