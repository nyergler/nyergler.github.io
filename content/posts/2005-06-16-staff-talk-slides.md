Tuesday I gave two talks at CC in San Francisco. The first, [Software for the Commons][1]  is an overview of the software Iâ€™ve developed in my year at CC, and was presented to most of the staff. The second was presented to Mike and our tech interns, Brian and Will, and covered the new [ccPublisher 2 Architecture][2] . Links are to slides.
