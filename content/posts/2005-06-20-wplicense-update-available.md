I’ve just uploaded the 0.2 update for [wpLicense][1] . wpLicense is a [WordPress][2]  plugin which allows you to choose a Creative Commons license for your blog via a handful of [functions][3]  which can be used in templates. The 0.2 release adds support for including Work metadata, as well as fixing a few issues with the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> rendering in the initial release.

I’ve also created a [wiki page][4]  where you can record changes you’d like to see in the next release.
