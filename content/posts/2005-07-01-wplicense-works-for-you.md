So last month I [announced the release][1]  of [wpLicense][2]  0.2. Since then I’ve received half a dozen reports of people having problems with the license selector showing up properly. I assume this is a bug in my <span class="caps">AJAX</span> code somewhere, but haven’t been able to track it down. So if it works for you or doesn’t work for you, I’d like to know.

If you have a second, leave a comment on this post. I’m interested in hearing whether wpLicense works for you or doesn’t and if it doesn’t, the problems you’ve run into. If you have had problems, details on your browser/operating system, and server’s <span class="caps">PHP</span> version would be extremely helpful. Thanks!
