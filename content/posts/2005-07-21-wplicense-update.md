So about [that][1]  “really, really works” comment — maybe only one “really” was in order. Anyway, [wpLicense 0.5.1][2]  is available. This corrects a bug which caused the selected license to mysteriously disappear when you edit other options. Very confusing, as you might imagine. So go, upgrade like the wind!
