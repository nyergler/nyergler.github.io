[Drunken Blog][1]  is running [an interview][2]  with [Wil Shipley][3] , founder of [The Omni Group][4]  and more recently [Delicious Monster][5] . While not exactly ground-breaking, Wil does have some interesting insights into starting software shops, and reasons to develop for Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X. Most interesting to me was the revelation that Wil [<span class="caps">STRIKEOUT</span>:suffers from] deals with chronic depression and agorophobia. Huh, I thought, that sounds familiar. I really liked his description of depressive episodes, though:

> Depression is a sucky thing to deal with because it doesn’t have much to do with how you’re doing in life. I feel ungrateful every time I get sad, because in general my life really isn’t too hard. I can say to myself, “Look, you’ve proven that you don’t produce enough seratonin, you don’t have to feel guilty for the tricks your brain is playing on you,” but I still feel like a spoiled child.
Yeah, that’s about it — sometimes the psuedo-guilt is almost as bad as the “30 wet blankets”. Almost.
