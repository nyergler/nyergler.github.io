[Mike][1]  pointed out that I’m not the only one who [doesn’t love working from home][2]  — well, the isolation part of it, at least. Brad Neuberg has started a [Coworking][3]  effort in San Francisco. Described as “Community for Developers Who Work From Home”, Brad focuses more on things like group meditation and yoga than I would choose to, but it sounds a lot like something I’d like. I’m curious to see how it progresses.
