I played with Apple’s [Spotlight][1]  quite a bit when I was prototyping the Creative Commons extension to it. Today I was trying to find something on my Windows machine and I started to pull up the Windows Search tool, planning to go get lunch and come back to see if it found what I wanted. Then I remembered that I’d installed [Google Desktop Search 2][2]  recently and that it does more than just display a cool sidebar. Of course, it does too much more.

I wanted to find something by filename (my .emacs file, which I can never remember where it’s at on Win32). Searching Google Desktop was fast, but it returned **everything** on my system containing “emacs”. What I’d really like from Google Desktop is something that seems pretty natural to me (and apparently Apple’s engineers, too) — the ability to search on a particular attribute. So is this really a missing feature, or have I just missed some super secret search syntax?
