[This][1]  might not be **the** solution, but it’s better than anything I’ve seen the Bush administration propose for dealing with the aftermath of Katrina.

Oh, and while we’re talking about helping others, I feel like I need to remind people that sometimes we can’t help as much as we’d like, because the government’s braindead regulations prevent it. Case in point: Sure, I’d love to donate blood since the local Red Cross is asking, but I can’t. I’m gay.
