I’m in a bitter, foul mood this morning after [yesterday’s news][1] . On the way to the coffee shop this morning I saw a minivan with one of those noxious Promise Keeper’s bumper stickers — “I (heart) My Wife”. I’d like to suggest a couple alternatives:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    “My wife’s a nagging bitch, death can’t part us soon enough”
  </li>
  <li>
    “All that stands between me and decent sex is this bumper sticker”
  </li>
  <li>
    “I (heart) my wife — everyone else thinks she’s a cunt”
  </li>
</ul>

That’s all.
