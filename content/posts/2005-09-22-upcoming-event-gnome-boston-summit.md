I’m going to be traveling to Boston for the first time in October for the [Gnome Boston Summit 2005][1] . Looks like a really interesting [group of people][2]  are planning to attend, most (OK, all) of whom have way more Gnome-street-cred (if there is such a thing) than I. I’m working on cooking up some ideas to bat around with the geeks — I’ll post them here as they become demo-worthy.

So here’s what I want to talk to other developers about:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    we’re pretty good at licensing — what about discovery?
  </li>
  <li>
    and once you discover content, how do you remix it? what can we do to make Gnome a killer remix platform?
  </li>
  <li>
    beyond remix, what about “original” creation that uses parts or influences from other works — what does a UI for that look like?
  </li>
  <li>
    we’ve got this embedded metadata, what should we be doing to leverage it?
  </li>
  <li>
    finally, what apps/file types should we be targetting for better metadata support?
  </li>
</ul>

So if you’re going to be there and want to talk about how we integrate content discovery and reuse into the desktop, look me up.
