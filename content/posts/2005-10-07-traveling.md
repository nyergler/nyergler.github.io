So it’s a testament to the complete insanity of my life lately that my last post was over 10 days ago, and it was about the event I just arrived at. I’m planning a future entry on what’s been going on at work and at school, because I think both are interesting, but here’s a preview: rolling out a new server platform the day you launch a fundraising campaign? Don’t. Really.

I finally made it to Boston just under an hour ago, and to my [hotel][1]  30 minutes after that. Perhaps if they give the bankrupt airlines an [extra 14 years][2]  to pay back their loans they can also require them to accurately report delays **before** the scheduled take off time. I knew it was a bad sign when my flight was scheduled to leave at 3:<span class="caps">40PM</span>, and they moved another flight to the same gate, taking off at 3:30 (“No, Mr. Yergler, your flight looks good.”). We were later told that we were waiting on a plane from Dallas (or was it Denver?) that took off 15 minutes **after** we were scheduled to leave Indianapolis. How that’s defined as “looking good” is beyond me.

So tomorrow is the start of the [Gnome Hacker Summit][3] , although why [Luis is looking forward to meeting me][4]  is quite a mystery. <span class="caps">OK</span>, sleep, then up early to fix lingering bugs in the website.
