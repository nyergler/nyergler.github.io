So I just saw a story reporting that Palm is [replacing the <span class="caps">SIM</span> tray][1]  for Treo 650 users. That totally ruins my <span class="caps">VC</span> opportunity. Garrett’s 650 had this problem — you bumped it or put it in your pocket and the phone portion turned off. Not exactly a desirable feature, huh? So I crafted the “<span class="caps">SIM</span> Shim”, which I figured was the perfect opportunity for a <span class="caps">VC</span>-funded startup I could ride into a firey crash. <span class="caps">OK</span>, so it was really just card stock cut to the shape of the <span class="caps">SIM</span> card, but it worked better than any solution Cingular had (“uh, just check it periodically, sir”). Damn you Palm!
