So I just saw a story reporting that Palm is [replacing the SIM tray][1]  for Treo 650 users. That totally ruins my VC opportunity. Garrett’s 650 had this problem — you bumped it or put it in your pocket and the phone portion turned off. Not exactly a desirable feature, huh? So I crafted the “SIM Shim”, which I figured was the perfect opportunity for a VC-funded startup I could ride into a firey crash. OK, so it was really just card stock cut to the shape of the SIM card, but it worked better than any solution Cingular had (“uh, just check it periodically, sir”). Damn you Palm!
