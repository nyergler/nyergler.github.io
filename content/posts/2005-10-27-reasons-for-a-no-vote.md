So as you’ve probably heard, Miers has [withdrawn herself][1]  from consideration for Sandra Day O’Connor’s seat on the Supreme Court. Lots of people gave lots of reasons as to why she wasn’t a suitable candidate: lack of a constitutional law record, lack of judicial experience (hello, Rehnquist?!), and lack of any real information.

![Scary-et Miers][2] What concerns me most is the reason no one mentioned: her apparent utter lack of ability to apply eye liner appropriately. Seriously, I haven’t been in drag for over 5 years, and **I** could apply better eyes while driving and drinking a latte. Where are people’s priorities?
