We’ve been enjoying something of an Indian Summer for the past few weeks here in Indiana. Temps had consistently been in the 50s or 60s, and I only had to break out my winter coat last week. The downside of this is a lack of snow. I enjoy snow skiing, but haven’t taken the opportunity to do it for the past couple years. So I’m really anxious to get out. And with the warm weather, well, the nearby (3 hours-ish) Michigan ski areas haven’t been able to get a base established. So I just checked the ski cam at [Bittersweet][1] .

It’s a start. I think I’m the only person I know who sees heavy wet snow as a desirable weather pattern.
