OK, so let’s ignore for a moment the fact that I just don’t understand [Log Cabin Republicans][1]  (rel=nofollow, of course). More to the point, I understand them even less than straight Republicans. But have they forgotten **they’re gay!?** Via [QueerDay][2] , STLtoday.com [reports][3]  that the LCR has asked the University of Missouri St. Louis to investigate a drag show because the performers:

> &#8230;mocked heterosexual people in the audience, wore revealing outfits, used inappropriate language and simulated sex acts.
Uh, so what exactly is the problem? That describes the more _respectable_ drag shows I’ve attended. Sounds like a down right wholesome evening.

**UPDATE** [Good as You][4]  has more additoinal [coverage][5]  .
