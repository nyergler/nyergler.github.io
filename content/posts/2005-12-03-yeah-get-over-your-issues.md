So [Good As You][1]  [pointed out][2]  an [article][3]  on the American Family Associations website which highlights the work of (and I can’t make this up) **Jews Against Anti-Christian Defamation** (JAACD). Apparently the JAACD is fed up with people trying to take Christ out of Christmas and persecute those poor, underpriveleged Christians. Now I happen to agree on one level; the word Christmas implies an association with Christ. But I’m not sure it’s the “non-believers” that bear the responsibility here, especially since they keep reminding us that those believers are in the alledged majority.Â Maybe someone from the AFA can explain to me how shopping for low-cost, low-class garments at J.C. Penny reminds us that “Jesus is the reason for the season.”

So a quote from the representative of the JAACD:

> “Why would a group of Jews who don’t celebrate Christmas care about the disappearance of Christmas?” Feder asked, anticipating the question from his listeners. “Because Christmas is disappearing,” he proceeded to explain.
Uh, I hate to tell you this, but that doesn’t explain why you care (and just saying it’s disappearing doesn’t make it so). But things get really good at the end of the article:

> Meanwhile, he adds, hypersensitive non-believers need to get over their issues with Christmas and respectfully allow the expression of the beliefs of the majority of Americans.
Does anyone else see the irony here? “Yeah, people who are hypersensitive about the beliefs and practices of others, they need to get over it! I mean, people other than us, of course.” I’d like to propose a deal — I’ll “get over it” in accordance with that statement, if they’ll substitute “heterosexuals” for “non-believers” and “sweaty man sex” for “Christmas” and get the fuck over it themselves.
