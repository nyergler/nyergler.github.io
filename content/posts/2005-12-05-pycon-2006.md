So registration is open for PyCon 2006, taking place in lovely greater Dallas late February, 2006. Here’s a few links for the interested:

* [Slate of accepted talks][1]  * [Tutorial information][2]  (new this year) * [Registration][3]

Once again I’ll be presenting this year. My talk, [“Extensible Desktop Applications: Abusing the Zope 3 Project”][4] , will cover how we’re using pieces of the Zope 3 project in our desktop apps at Creative Commons. Should be a good time.
