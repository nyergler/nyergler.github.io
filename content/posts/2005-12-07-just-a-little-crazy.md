So I’m sitting at the coffee shop, up since 4 AM, more than a little sleep deprived working on finishing my software engineering presentation for this morning.Â  And I’m listening to the [Muriel’s Wedding][1]  soundtrack, and I have the uncontrollable urge to kick back my chair and do the swinging arm dance to ABBA’s Waterloo.Â  OK, I’m going just a little bit crazy.
