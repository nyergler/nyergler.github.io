So there’s a minor update available for [wpLicense][1] , and it’ll probably be most interesting to the Mac users in the audience. [wpLicense 0.5.2][2]  fixes a bug which broke the license selector under Safari. Oops. I’m not sure if the bug was Safari-specific or KHTML-specific, so if you’ve had problems with wpLicense under Konqueror, you may want to give this a try.
