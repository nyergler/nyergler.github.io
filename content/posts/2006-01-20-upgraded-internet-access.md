Aaron [wrote about][1]  dumping Earthlink <span class="caps">DSL</span> for Time-Warner cable internet service. I feel his pain, except I just did a different sort of upgrade. I’ve been a Comcast Cable internet service customer for _years_. And it hasn’t been half bad. I’m not sure it’s been half good either, but that’s a different story. But two days ago I traded one evil incumbent monopoly for another with the installation of [Verizon <span class="caps">FIOS</span>][2]  internet service. This is fiber optic based service — 5 Mbps downstream, 2 Mbps upstream, $34 per month. For an extra $10 per month you can get 15 Mbps downstream. The savings per bandwidth aren’t as dramatic as Aaron’s, but hey — it’s freakin fast. Which is interesting if you think about it, since Comcast also claimed a downstream speed of 5 Mbps on my cable service.
