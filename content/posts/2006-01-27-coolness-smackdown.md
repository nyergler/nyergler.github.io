Apparently [I’m cooler than][1]  [Mike][2]  — more accurately my domain is: yergler.net’s <span class="caps">FCR</span> of 2.86 easily best’s gondwanaland.com’s measly 0.95. Personally, well, not as cool as Mike (more accurately the set containing all Yerglers is less cool than the set containing all Linksvayers): 2.66 for Yerglers, stomped by 4.57 for Linksvayers.
