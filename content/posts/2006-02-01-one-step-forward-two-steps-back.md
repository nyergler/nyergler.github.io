I had dinner with my grandfather last night. Well, I don’t know if you can call a meal at 4:30 in the afternoon dinner, but that’s beside the point. I hadn’t seen him since the new year, so it was good to spend some time together. In fact, it was really a nice time until he asked, “Nate, do you ever think of just walking away from all this you’re involved in?” Note that in the code of my family, “all this you’re involved in” is approxiamately equal to “your raging homosexuality.” Sigh.
