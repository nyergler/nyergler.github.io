It’s never an [isolated incident][1]  ; yesterday I received a note from another family member that included the sentence:

> “I so often pray you have a wife and children in your future.”
Look, a wife is one thing, but children? That’s just cruel.

Seriously, though, its hard to know how to feel about messages like this. I feel very strongly that it is important to let people believe what they wish, so long as they don’t impose their beliefs on my life. I believe this because it’s what I ask of them — that my beliefs be respected, even in the face of disagreement.

You know you’re depressed when you’re listening to Stevie Nick’s greatest “hits” and thinking “yeah, you tell &#8216;em sister.”
