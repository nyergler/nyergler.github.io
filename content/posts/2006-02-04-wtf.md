I went to [Panera Bread][1]  for a bagel and some tea this morning, and took my laptop along to check email adn get started on some work for the day. I went to add something to my blog (i.e., that page you’re looking at now), and here’s what I saw:

<div class="figure align-center">
  <img alt="yergler.net/blog blocked" src="http://yergler.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/blocked.png" />

  <p class="caption">
    yergler.net/blog blocked
  </p>
</div>

Seriously?
