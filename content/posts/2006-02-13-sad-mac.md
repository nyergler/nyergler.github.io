So my iMac (a [17” G4/1.25GHz model][1] ) died last week. When I turn it on, the backlight comes on, it makes the Apple sound, but nothing happens video wise, either on the built in screen or the external monitor port. Does anyone have any suggestions on ways to save it without spending a bundle? If it can’t be saved, any suggestions on a cheap replacement? I need to build ccPublisher for OS X, among other things.
