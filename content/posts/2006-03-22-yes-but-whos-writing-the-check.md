I’m in my last semester of undergraduate work, and between a full time school load and full time work load, some things fall through the cracks. Usually school things. I have a professor who likes to say “I’ve worked in industry, and I know what the result would be if you were this late with a work product.” Yeah. So have I (and so do I). But in this case, _I’m_ the one writing the check.
