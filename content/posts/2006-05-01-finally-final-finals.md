It’s a little surreal, and more than a little overwhelming, but this is finals week at school. Not _just_ finals week, but the final finals week of my undergraduate career. In 4 days my last semester will be complete, and I can return to a having real life. Things I hope to do once classes are off my plate:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    Finish reading the pile of books on my nightstand
  </li>
  <li>
    Write more on my blog about software engineering
  </li>
  <li>
    Write more software (since my employer has been incredibly, incredibly understanding)
  </li>
  <li>
    Take more pictures
  </li>
  <li>
    Ride my bike more often
  </li>
  <li>
    And, uh, think about graduate school (because apparently I’m quite insane)
  </li>
</ul>

In case anyone is wondering, no, taking 16 credit hours in the form of 5 classes while working 30 hours a week is not advisable.
