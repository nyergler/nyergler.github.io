So it’s official: I am educated. Well, as educated as possessing a B.S. implies, which I suppose could be up for debate. This week has been my first working “full time” (as opposed my 3/4 time status when I was in school), and I’ve spent it working on getting back into the swing of work. Well, I was working hard while in school, but it was in fits and spurts, and my attention was always divided. Even now it’s a little weird to not have school hanging over my head. I keep looking at my schedule thinking “OK, so I have two months until August, so what do I want to accomplish while I can pay close attention to it.” I’m sure I’ll get used to it.

I used this increase in work (and new focus on it) to justify a new laptop purchase. After some looking around I ended up going with the Dell Inspiron E1505. I’ve always had a somewhat irrational prejudice against Inspirons, but it simply came down to the fact that _no one_ could touch the price and feature set that the Inspiron had. After finding a couple of “unadvertised” coupon codes, I would up saving about $800 dollars. One the downside it is larger than my last laptop, which was a nice balance of size and functionality. But I’m already spoiled by the 15.4” [STRIKEOUT:[WSXGA+][1] ] 1680×1050 display. I had to use my old laptop to retrieve some information last night, and my first thought was “god, that text is huge! what a crappy display!” (it’s the basic 14” 1280×768 WXGA size).

So I want to write some wrap-up about this past semester. My level of blogging has been pretty abysmal, so I’d like to give people an idea of what I’ve been working on the past 5 months. And I also have some ideas I’d like to get down, so hopefully I’ll get that done soon, too. I’m flying out to San Francisco on Sunday morning (I have _got_ to stop taking 9 AM flights out of an airport two and a half hours away) so my goal is to get some writing (both code and text) done on the plane. We’ll see if that really happens.
