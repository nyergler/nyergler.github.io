I understand that you are quite concerned about [judicial activism][1] . I appreciate your concern regarding historical precedent and [original intent][2] . Perhaps you could [STRIKEOUT:re-]read the [Federalist Papers][3]  for additional perspective. In particular I recommend [Number 10][4] . I’m sure you’ll find Madison’s thoughts on the tyranny of the majority fascinating. One reading is that your majority [STRIKEOUT:and political capital] (sorry, I forgot that where once there was a surplus there is now a deficit) justify the Federal Marriage Amendment. I submit that an alternate reading is that judges are simply protecting a minority of the population from said tyranny. Since you _are_ “[the decider][5] “, I eagerly await your decision.

Patriotically,

Nathan
