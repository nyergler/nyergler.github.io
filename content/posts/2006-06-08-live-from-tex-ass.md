Once again I’m late to the party, but I’ve been listening to [Sufjan Stevens’][1]  excellent _\`Come on feel the Illinoise <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois\_%28album%29>\`\__, the second in his proposed series of 50 albums, one for each state. The album features an amazingly poignant ballad “[John Wayne Gacy, Jr][2] “ about the serial killer of the same name. Illlinoise is one of the most unique albums I’ve heard in quite a while.

Given the current political situation, I’d like to make a suggestion for a future Sufjan album: when you get to Texas, perhaps you can honor the G-W with another serial killer ballad. Just a thought.
