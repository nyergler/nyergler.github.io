So I spent last week in sunny Key West for a post-graduation, much needed vacation.Â  I usually go on record as anti-vacation — I like to think my life isn’t something that needs escaping —Â  but five days of sunning, snorkeling and, well, doing nothing, was really nice.Â  So today I’m heading down to the [iCommons][1]  [iSummit][2]  in Rio de Janeiro.Â  I’m going to be traveling something like 23 hours: [Fort Wayne, Indiana][3]  to [Cleveland, Ohio][4]  to [Houston, Texas][5]  to [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil][6]  (with a one hour stop in[Sao Paulo][7] ).Â Of course, the first leg is already delayed; luckily there’s [FlightView][8]  which lets me be completely obsessive-compulsive about the inbound plane.Â  Yay for technology.
