Since SourceForge started providing Subversion for source control, I’ve suddenly found myself in a world where none of the old <span class="caps">CVS</span> knowledge matters any more. Of course, this world also occasionally requires me to do things in Subversion that I didn’t do that often before. So I’ve started a [Subversion Cheat Sheet][1]  in the Yiki. Now showing: migrating part of your tree from one repository to another, with history.
