After OSCON last week I’m in San Francisco, getting some face time with the rest of the [Creative Commons][1]  staff. Yesterday I went to the [Up Your Alley][2]  fair, part of the [Folsom Street Fair][3]  family. Billed as a “smaller, more local” event that _only_ attracts 12,000 people, I think it’s an understatement to say we have nothing like this in Indiana. But the best part wasn’t the assless chaps, jock straps, harnesses or hot guys. It was what you heard.
