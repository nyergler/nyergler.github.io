My hometown, [Bluffton, Indiana][1], is featured in [today’s USA
Today][2]. Apparently Bluffton is one of the first communities
to implement a National League of Cities program on diversity
and inclusion. They’ll be placing signs stating “Welcome. We are
building an inclusive community.“ I don’t dislike Bluffton in
general, but have chosen not to live there for a reason. But I
definitely like it when I can feel proud about something going
on there.
