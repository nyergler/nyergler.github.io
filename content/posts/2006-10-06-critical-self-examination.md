A recent message to the [cc-icommons][1]  mailing list pointed readers to a self-described “slick” [critical report][2]  of the [iSummit][3]  held in Rio earlier this year. The reporter, Andrew Garton, takes Creative Commons to task for the “self-congratulatory” atmosphere, the acceptance of Microsoft as a sponsor and our apparently over-zealous promotion of Microsoft’s [<span class="caps">CC</span> licensing plugin][4]  for Microsoft Office (among other things). Garton questions if the same response would have been equal had a similar plugin been developed for [OpenOffice.org][5] . I can’t speak for Creative Commons as an organization or any other staff member. What I _can_ say is that I would personally have been even **more** enthusiastic about an OOo version, because that would mean I could actually _use_ it.

I think that critical self-examination is a good thing, both at the personal and organizational level. But after an initial read, here’s the rub in my mind:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    Implying that we would be less enthusiastic about an OOo plugin because we accepted sponsorship from Microsoft is at best the moral equivalent of an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">ad hominem</a> argument.
  </li>
  <li>
    The scholarships <span class="caps">CC</span> handed out to enable greater (broader) attendance of the iSummit weren’t free; they relied on, uh, <em>sponsorship</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can’t even debate how well we would promote an OOo plugin because <strong>no one has written one</strong>. It’s not like I took time out of my work schedule to write a Microsoft plugin or even to assist them with coding. They simply took advantage of our <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Web_Services">**publicly available**</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://api.creativecommons.org">web services</a> and <em>built it</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The amount of crap I took at the iSummit as a <span class="caps">CC</span> employee for “helping Microsoft” was, well, ridiculous. If you want something different, maybe you should stop whining about it and start coding.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/rhythmbeatingsilenceakarbs/180685902/in/set-72157594186007575/">Red noses</a> are dumb. Throwing paper wads at the presenter from Microsoft (which Garton fails to mention as another “protest” action) is not only disrespectful, but makes you look like a child. A spoiled, petulant brat of a child. [God, I’ve been wanting to say that for <strong>months</strong>!]
  </li>
</ul>

So those are my own initial thoughts. As I was reading the <span class="caps">PDF</span> in Evince, I happened to look at the document properties. Huh, that’s interesting. Written using Microsoft Word, generated used Distiller for Microsoft WIndows.

_“Mmmm… that’s some good irony; with just a hint of hypocrisy.”_
