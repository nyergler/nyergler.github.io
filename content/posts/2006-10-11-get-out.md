Today is National Coming Out Day. If you’re in the closet, I hope you’re trying on your mother’s shoes and lipstick. Since I’m already out (and have been for nearly 10 years now), I’ll celebrate by mentioning how amusing I find it that [Wonkette][1]  is referring to the Foley-scandal-du-jour as the [Cocktober Suprise][2]  Tee-hee.
