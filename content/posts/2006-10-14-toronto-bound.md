So it looks like I’m going to be presenting at the Seneca [Free Software and Open Source Symposium][1]  later this month. I’ll be presenting about our work on [MozCC 2][2] , with a talk titled [Little s Semantic: Exploring Metadata About the Web.][3]  Who knows, maybe I’ll even work in something about this mythical [MozCC for Songbird][4]  I’ve heard about ;).
