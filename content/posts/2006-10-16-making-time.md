I ran across [Timeline][1]  a few weeks ago, from the folks who brought you [PiggyBank][2] . Timeline is an [<span class="caps">STRIKEOUT</span>:<span class="caps">AJAX</span>] Javascript tool that allows you to create slick, draggable timeline representations of date-oriented data. This is pretty slick by itself, but then I ran across the [WordPress Timeline][3]  plugin, which lets you auto-magically generate a timeline from any WordPress category. What Iâ€™d love to see is something that published a local stream of data showing what I worked on, browsed, created, editted, etc that was usable by Timeline. Sort of a dynamic window into slacking.
