Dear Lazy Web,

Ever since upgrading to Ubuntu Edgy Eft (which I admittedly did before it hit official beta), the file selector in Gnome shows hidden files. How do I hide them?

**<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>**: Uh, never mindâ€¦ I discovered right-clicking the file list displays a menu with a helpful option: _Show hidden files_. Sigh.
