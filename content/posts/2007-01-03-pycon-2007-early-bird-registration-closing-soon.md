So I’m registered and have my plane ticket for [PyCon 2007][1] , taking place once again in the [lovely Addison, Texas][2] . Early bird [registration][3]  ends in 12 days, so save US$65 and register now.

I’m actually really excited about this years conference: the [slate of talks][4]  looks really good, and for the first time I’m _not_ speaking. Why is this a good thing? Because in the past last minute preparations and general public-speaking-nervousness have made it difficult to really enjoy things. So taking a break seems… welcome.

See you in Texas.
