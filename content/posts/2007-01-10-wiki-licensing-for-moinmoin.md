Iâ€™ve been using [MoinMoin][1]  for managing the non-blog content of [yergler.net][2]  for some time now, and its mostly been a great choice for me. Just enough through-the-web management to make maintaining the content less burdensome. One feature I noticed it was missing (compared to [MediaWiki][3] , which we use [at work][4] ) is Creative Commons license support. After I started to do some digging I found that there _is_ support for a wiki license page. If enabled, this adds some text to the editor pages notifying contributors that their content will be subject to the site license.

So over the weekend I put together [MoinLicense][5] . MoinLicense is a pair of actions and a macro for MoinMoin which enables license selection. In addition to supporting a site-wide license, MoinLicense allows you to select a particular license for any page. Details, download information and known issues are in [the wiki][5] , natch.
