I’ve spent the first part of this week in San Francisco for some face time with the rest of the [Creative Commons][1]  staff and participating in what I believe are our first all-staff meetings [[1]][2]{#id1.footnote-reference}. This afternoon I’m flying to Dallas for [PyCon 2007][3] . The program looks really strong this year, and I’m looking forward to a few days of what you could almost call a vacation. A really, really geeky vacation.

My goal is to blog the sessions I attend, but that’s been my goal every year and I usually end up doing about 25%. We’ll see just how well it works this time around.
