[Matt][1]  summarizes the PyCon’s Testing Tools Panel far better than I could [here][2] . I was also hoping for some more… depth, perhaps? I think that a problem with both the web frameworks and testing tools panels is that they had too many participants for the half-hour-ish time slot. Regardless it served as a good overview of the available tools (if nothing else giving me a list to start Googling from).
