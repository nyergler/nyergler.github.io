Starting yesterday afternoon I found that I couldn’t commit code to Creative Commons’ Subversion repository at [Sourceforge][1] . “Just another intermittent outage,” I thought. I even took a look at the [site status][2]  page, saw that Subversion was “online” and figured it’d be resolved by the morning.

Well this morning it’s still down, so I took another look. Yup, still online:

And then you scroll down and find the truth:

So can someone explain to me how “completely inaccessible due to a massive <span class="caps">DDOS</span> attack” (my words) is in any way equivalent to “online”?
