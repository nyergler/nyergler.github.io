I [wrote earlier][1]  about my initial experiences of putting Ubuntu 7.04 on my MacBook. I’ve received a few comments and offline requests about that post asking for help, so I just wanted to let people know that I can’t provide assistance. The `ndiswrapper` approach isn’t stable for me using either the Lenovo or D-Link driver, and I can’t deal with kernel panics when I boot up if it detects a network it doesn’t like. So no wi-fi means no Linux; when [MadWifi][2]  fixes support for the Atheros chipset (see [ticket 1001][3] ), I’ll be back. In the meantime, it’s all OS X all the time on the MacBook.
