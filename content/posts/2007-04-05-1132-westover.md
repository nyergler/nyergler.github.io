I turned 30 in November of last year, and the months since have been full of changes. I can’t write about some of them yet, and I’m not ready to write about others, but this one I can share. I’m selling my house in Fort Wayne, Indiana. You can find a map of the area, with a few things I love about the neighborhood over at [My Google Maps][1] . I’ll try to add some additional things as I think of them.

The house isn’t listed with a Realtor yet; probably in the next week or two. But if you’re interested, feel free to contact me — I love this house, it’s just time to move on.
