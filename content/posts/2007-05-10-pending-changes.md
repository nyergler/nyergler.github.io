I’ve avoided writing anything detailed about the changes happening in my life for a while now, mostly out of fear of “jinxing” something (and because I needed to get to a place where I was <span class="caps">OK</span> just talking about some of them). [My bio][1]  on the [Creative Commons][2]  [staff listing][3]  has been updated for a while now, but I haven’t mentioned it here: starting a couple weeks ago, I’m the new <span class="caps">CTO</span> at Creative Commons. I’ve told some friends that this is the first job in years I don’t really know how to do[1]_, and that’s a pretty exciting place to be for me.

This change in position at work has led to the second big change in my life, one that was given away by a commenter [back in April][4] . Next month, I’m moving to San Francisco. I’ve actually been working from the office in <span class="caps">SF</span> this week, getting up to speed on things. I was intending to look at neighborhoods so I’d know where to look when it finally came time to move out here. I assumed that the sale of the house would be a lingering, drawn-out process, and that in July or August I’d finally convince someone to take the house — “please!” — and be able to move. It’s been a bit faster than that.

The house went into <span class="caps">MLS</span> on Monday, April 30. On Tuesday we had two showings, and by Tuesday night I had an offer. Wednesday I countered, and by the end of the day my counter offer had been accepted. So yeah, the house sold in under a week[2]_. The buyers have already sold their home, and are closing May 24, so our agreement calls for us to close by May 31, with possession 7 days later.

So this week I’ve been actually looking for an apartment for [Madeline][5]  and myself. Finding an apartment in my price range that will take a dog has been a bit of a challenge, but this afternoon I’m signing a lease for a one bedroom near [Duboce and Church][6] . I like the location a lot, as it seems pretty close to lots of things (including a park for Maddie) which is important since I’m selling my car before I leave. So yeah, barring something unforeseen, I’ll be living in San Francisco in less than a month. Wow.
