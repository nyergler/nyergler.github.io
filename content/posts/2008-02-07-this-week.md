Things that I’ve done in the past seven days:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    Spent most of the time in Logan, UT. It’s been <em>very</em> snowy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Took <a class="reference external" href="http://yergler.net/Madeline">Madeline</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://petcamp.com">PetCamp</a> where I agreed to pay $4 for the “Super Bowl Special” — extra play time, a hot dog, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.beerfordogs.com/">doggie beer</a>, and the game on the television. Not that I was planning to watch myself, but who can say no to doggie beer?
  </li>
  <li>
    Went skiing with Richard at <a class="reference external" href="http://skithebeav.com">Beaver Mountain</a>; photos coming.
  </li>
  <li>
    Participated in the OER Sprint at <a class="reference external" href="http://cosl.usu.edu/">COSL</a>. While there I’ve been working on the <a class="reference external" href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">CC Learn</a> Open Education Search. This entailed learning more about <a class="reference external" href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/">Nutch</a> than I ever planned, but I’m getting the hang of it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Helped (for some definition of “help”) develop <a class="reference external" href="http://oerfeeds.info">oerfeeds.info</a> — a single location sites can register their feeds at (RSS, Atom, <a class="reference external" href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI&#8211;PMH</a>) so they can be used by other sites building on OER.
  </li>
</ul>

Tomorrow I head to Los Angeles for “SCALE”:<http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/> ; I’ll be [speaking][1]  on Sunday about integrating CC into applications. Woot[1]_.
