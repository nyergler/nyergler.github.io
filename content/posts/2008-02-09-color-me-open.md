It’s not exactly a [secret][1]  that [OpenOffice.org][2]  and I have a love-hate relationship (nor that it frequently tilts towards the _hate_ side of things). But I’ve yet to find a better free software package for presentations, so like a couple with a mountain of shared assets in a no-fault divorce state, we’re stuck together.

[Alex][3]  (CC&#8217;s crack-graphic-designer) put together a [color palette][4]  for use when producing CC publications, and [Jon Phillips][5]  began using it quite effectively (in my opinion) in [his presentations][6] . I tried doing something similar for my talk at [COMMUNIA][7]  last month using one of Jon’s slide decks as a starting point, but OOo Impress kept eating my master slides (and not showing me the actual colors used). So I jumped over to [Slidy][8] . The results were mixed: I was able to explicitly specify my color choices in CSS, but when I went to present the fact I had designed the talk on my [Eee PC][9]  at a wonky resolution ([WVGA][10] ) caused lots of font weirdness.

So as I prepare for [SCALE 6X][11]  I’m back with OpenOffice.org, still wanting to use the CC and Tango color palettes. So I dug in and created a couple of palette files; you can find them on the [CC Colors][4]  page. Note that I’m still not sure how to make OOo just “find” them and add them to the full palette, but they are usable and hopefully they’ll ease _some_ of the pain.
