Still working on my slides for [<span class="caps">SCALE</span>][1] , decided to further delay productivity by putting together a brief set of steps on how to use [OpenOffice.org][2]  [Impress][3]  to get **really** pissed off.

<ol class="arabic simple">
  <li>
    Start up OOo Impress and create a new presentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open up the master slide view and create two new masters; make them somewhat visually distinct so that its easy to experience the pure frustration later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Return to the slide view and make sure you can see the Master Pages area of the Tasks page; note that both your master slides are listed as “used in this presentation”, but not “available for use”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the first master, which should re-apply the master to the slide you’re looking at.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the second master to apply it to the slide.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Note that the first master has now disappeared.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Think to yourself, “well surely it’s not <em>gone</em> and return to the master view.
  </li>
  <li>
    Realize that no, the slide really has disappeared.
  </li>
</ol>

Is it any surprise that you see a proliferation of Macs and Keynote at tech conferences, that people think slide-ware generally sucks, or that people still equate PowerPoint with presentations?

I _think_ this is the same as [Issue #43354][4] , reported in **February, 2005**. Sigh.
