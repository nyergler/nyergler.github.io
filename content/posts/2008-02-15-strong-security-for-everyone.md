I received some press-release-spam this week that I actually didn’t mind. [TrustBearer Labs][1] , a [home-town][2]  [startup][3]  has released their new [OpenID][4]  provider, [TrustBearer OpenID][5] . What makes this interesting is that it utilizes their browser-based authentication hardware support to instantly provide strong, token-based security to any OpenID enabled site (application?). Their browser software is interesting in and of itself — cross platform (Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, Linux), cross browser (Safari, <span class="caps">IE</span>, Firefox), and capable of interfacing with <span class="caps">USB</span> smart card readers and authentication tokens. This is a great demonstration of what open standards really allow — innovation that benefits everyone who utilizes the standard.
