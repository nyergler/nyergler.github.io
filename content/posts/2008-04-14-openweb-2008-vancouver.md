I’m in Canada ([O! Canada!][1] ) for the [OpenWeb Vancouver 2008][2]  conference today and tomorrow. I’ll be speaking tomorrow morning on Creative Commons licenses and the Semantic Web — specifically about how things like [ccREL][3]  and [RDFa][4]  allow us to build a real life, scalable, extensible Semantic Web deployment without really thinking about it (“It’s SemWeb! And _I_ helped!”)

OpenWeb Vancouver is a community run conference, much like [PyCon][5] . And much like PyCon it looks like it has a really great value proposition (unfortunately much like PyCon it also seems to have crappy [wifi][6] &#8230; sigh).

I’ll post slides soon (read: when I actually write them).
