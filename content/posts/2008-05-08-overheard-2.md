At the laundromat this morning, waiting for the cover for my sofa to dry.

> “Well, do you know? Do you know? I’m responsible for shutting that place down! That bar was drugging people and I figured it out! I went in there, and I _know_ my tolerance, because I drank a bottle of Skyy vodka before, so I **know** my tolerance. And after just two shots I passed out. You know what that means, right? I was drugged! Drugged!”
Uh, yeah, _that’s_ the logical conclusion.
