Yesterday was the first ever [Creative Commons][1]  [Technology Summit][2] , hosted at Google. [My photos][3]  and [better ones][4]  taken by Joi.

I drove the Nerd Van (myself, [Asheesh][6]  and the interns) to Google.

I’m still recovering (and inflicting pain — <span class="caps">CC</span> board meeting today) and collecting feedback, but I think it was a really successful day. We learned some things we’ll do differently next time (yes, there will be a next time). Anyway, special recognition to the <span class="caps">CC</span> interns for [live blogging][7]  the event and for generally doing anything asked of them. I feel like I should write more about the event, but I’m feeling pretty brain dead at the moment.
