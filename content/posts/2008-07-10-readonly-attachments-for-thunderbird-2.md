Last seen here [two years ago][1] , I’ve just updated [Readonly Attachments][2]  for [Thunderbird 2][3] . It still does pretty much exactly what the [last post][1]  describes, bugs and all.

Right now I’m just releasing a [preview][4] . At this point I’ve only tested it with Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 on Mac OS X 10.5.3; I’ll test with Linux tomorrow[1]_ and if all goes well I’ll update [addons.mozilla.org][5]  at that point.

**UPDATE:** (2008-07-13) Things seem to work fine on Linux, so we’re just waiting for it to clear the review queue at [AMO][5] .
