I’m in Portland, Oregon this week for [OSCON 2008][1] . [Asheesh][2]  and I are [speaking][3]  tomorrow on [ccREL][4]  and ``liblicense` <<http://wiki.creativecommons.org/liblicense> >\`_.

Things I’m hoping to see this week:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    lots of attention paid to <a class="reference external" href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>, not just as an alternative to Twitter but as a first step towards truly open services,
  </li>
  <li>
    lots of discussion about how free software can enable user autonomy,
  </li>
  <li>
    corporate suit-types excoriated for not giving back (or for expecting us to build our “open” systems on theirs (I’m looking at you, [STRIKEOUT:Sourceforge 2.0] Atlassian).
  </li>
</ul>

So I’m probably just dreaming when it comes to the last one (maybe all of them, particularly with my qualifier of _lots_), but for the first time in a few years, there are actually talks I want to go to scheduled against one another. Maybe I’ll have to revise [Yergler’s Theorem of Conference Value][5] . But probably not.
