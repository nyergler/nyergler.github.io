As seen on [SFist][1] , [<span class="caps">SF</span> <span class="caps">MTA</span>][2]  is asking for $300,000 to update the [<span class="caps">ATCS</span>][3]  (Advanced Train Control System) — the software which runs **the subway** — to Windows. Great. There may be carnage, but at least we’ll have [Aero][4] .
