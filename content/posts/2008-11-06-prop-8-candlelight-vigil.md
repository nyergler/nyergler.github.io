As I [mentioned yesterday][1] , I’m in Cambridge through this evening. This morning things feel a little better, a little more hopeful, around [Proposition 8][2]  (along with [<span class="caps">FL</span> 2][3]  and [<span class="caps">AZ</span> 102][4] ).

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    R went to the candlelight vigil in protest of Proposition 8 and <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/rtkim/sets/72157608699055001/">took photos</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    A former <span class="caps">CC</span> intern sent me an instant message last night saying his thoughts were with me and others in California effected by 8 (or “h8” as it’s being labeled on Twitter).
  </li>
  <li>
    Someone from the Fort Wayne <span class="caps">LUG</span> (a group I barely participated in while living in Fort Wayne) sent me an email expressing his disappointment.
  </li>
  <li>
    And a friend in San Francisco sent me a very kind email saying “this won’t last”.
  </li>
</ul>

I know this is a first world problem and I’m happy that I get to go home to a great circle of friends — my family of choice.
