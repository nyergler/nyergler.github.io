I’ve been aware of [Ubiquity][1]  since it launched and have meant to dig in and play with it for a while. I’m becoming increasingly reliant on my keyboard for fast interaction with the computer; I blame [gnome-do][2] . So using the keyboard to interact more quickly with my browser had a lot of appeal.

Today I finally installed [Ubiquity 0.5][3]  and looked at converting the [RDFa bookmarklets][4]  to Ubiquity commands. The bookmarklets are invaluable for debugging and exploring RDFa, but I don’t use them often enough to feel like I want them on my bookmark bar all the time.

Turns out that Ubiquity makes it really easy to convert a bookmarklet to a command. I’ve converted the Get N3 and RDFa Highlight bookmarklets and [made them available][5] . I’d like to convert the [fragment parser][6]  as well but I think that’ll be a little more involved.

To use the commands, just [install Ubiquity 0.5][7]  (or later for you visitors from the future) and visit [the commands page][5] . You’ll see a notification at the top of the browser window asking if you’d like to install the commands.
