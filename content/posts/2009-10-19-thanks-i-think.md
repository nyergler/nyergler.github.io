My vanity Google Alert turned up something a little strange today. A [track contributed][1]  to the Internet Archive’s Open Source Audio collection, entitled “Nathan R Yergler”. <span class="caps">OK</span>, more than a little strange, that’s weird.

It’s sort of relaxing to listen to, but… yeah, weird.
