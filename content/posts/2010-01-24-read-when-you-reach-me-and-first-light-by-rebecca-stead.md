I just finished reading _First Light_, by [Rebecca Stead][1] , after reading _When You Reach Me_ earlier this month. I liked _When You Reach Me_ so much that I gave it to James for his birthday, knowing we share a love of science fiction, with a special fondness for young adult science fiction. James has observed that young adult fiction is a joy to read, as it is driven almost entirely by character and story — no messy philosophy or moralistic exposition to get in the way of enjoying the story[[1]][2]{#id1.footnote-reference}. _When You Reach Me_ and _First Light_ are both great stories, imaginative and well executed. You can read either trying to divine the “Lesson” for the reader, but that’s optional: they’re just great stories that you can get lost in and enjoy.

_When You Reach Me_ takes place in 1970’s New York City, and tells the story of Miranda and her changing friendships at school. When her best friend, Sal, stops hanging out and she starts receiving mysterious notes, she’s left to figure out what’s going on. _When You Reach Me_ is written with great details that really make the setting and the place real to me. The characters — especially Miranda and her mother — have wonderful dialogue that makes them seem like real, individual people. Stead weaves [A Wrinkle In Time][3]  through the story, adding to the mystery (it’s clear early on that there’s some relation between the two stories) as well as giving the reader a clue that Miranda is not just any girl, she’s a girl who likes Madeline L’Engle.

[When You Reach Me][4]  won the [Newberry Medal][5]  this year, but I actually enjoyed Stead’s first novel, _First Light_, even more. _First Light_ has one of my favorite structures: multiple, seemingly independent plot lines. You’re sure they’re related some how, and seeing how the author brings them together — as well as how seamlessly — is part of the fun. In the case of _First Light_, we have the story of Thea, a girl living under the ice, and Peter, a boy from New York City whose father is studying glacial movement and whose mother is prone to “headaches” which take her away from reality for hours or days on end. Just as with _When You Reach Me_, Stead manages to create a cast of three dimensional, compelling characters, human and canine alike.
