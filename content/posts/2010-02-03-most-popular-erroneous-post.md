There are a few posts on my site that get the lion’s share of traffic. One of those is a one-off project I did to convert [Maildir to Mbox][1] . Today someone left a comment, saying that it didn’t work. And then I realized that somewhere along the line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.argv[-1]</span></tt> had been converted to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.argv[1]</tt>. Not really the same thing.

I’ve update the page, but it’s a little embarrassing to only realize 18 months (or more) after originally posting it that you’ve been giving out bum advice.

Eventually, I’ll be right.

<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
  <col class="field-name" /> <col class="field-body" /> <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      date:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">
      2010-02-03 21:41:14
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      wordpress_id:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">
      1454
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      layout:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">
      post
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">
      slug:
    </th>

    <td class="field-body">

  </tr>

  <tr class="field">

    <td class="field-body">

  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
    <th class="field-name">

    <td class="field-body">

  </tr>

  <tr class="field">
