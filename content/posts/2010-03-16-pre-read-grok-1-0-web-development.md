[|image0|][1] Late last month I received an email from [Packt Publishing][2]  ([en.wp][3] ), asking if I’d be interested in reviewing one of their new titles, _\`Grok 1.0 Web Development <http://www.packtpub.com/grok-1-0-web-development/book?utm\_source=yergler.net&utm\_medium=bookrev&utm\_content=blog&utm\_campaign=mdb\_002632>\`\__, by [Carlos de la Guardia][4] . I immediately said yes, with the caveat that I’m traveling a lot over the next 30 days, so the review will be a little delayed (hence this pre-review). I said “yes” because [Grok][5]  is one of the Python web frameworks that’s most interesting to me these days. It’s interesting because one of its underlying goals is to take concepts from [<span class="caps">STRIKEOUT</span>:Zope 3][Zope Toolkit][6] , and make them more accessible and less daunting. These concepts — the component model, pluggable utilities, and graph-based traversal — are some of the most powerful tools I’ve worked with during my career. And of course, they can also be daunting, even to people with lots of experience; making them more accessible is a good thing.

I’ve read the first four chapters of _Grok 1.0 Web Development_, and so far there’s a lot to like. It’s the sort of documentation I wish I’d had when I ported the Creative Commons [license chooser][7]  to Grok<sup>1</sup>. I’m looking forward to reading the rest, and will post a proper review when I return from Nairobi. In the mean time, check out [Grok][5] , Zope 3 for cavemen.

_You can download a preview from Grok 1.0 Web Development, \`Chapter 5: Forms </media/2010/03/7481-grok-1-0-Web-development-sample-chapter-5-forms.pdf>\`_._

<sup>1</sup> The <span class="caps">CC</span> license chooser has evolved a lot over the years; shortly after Grok was launched we adopted many of its features as a way to streamline the code. Grok’s simplified support for custom traversal, in particular, was worth the effort.
