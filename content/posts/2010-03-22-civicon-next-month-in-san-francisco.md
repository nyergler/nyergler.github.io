I’m honored to be asked to kick off the first ever [CiviCon][1]  [next month in San Francisco][2] . CiviCon is a one day conference for users of [CiviCRM][3] , a free software _constituent_ relationship management platform. CiviCRM is a key component of [Creative Commons’][4]  infrastructure (we use it as our [donor management system][5] ), and I’m excited to see the community come together and talk about new features, integration techniques, and ideas for future development.

When I was asked to present, I thought about what I could talk about, beyond simply our deployment and customization of CiviCRM (which [the other Nathan][6]  will do a great job of during [his presentation][7] ). Creative Commons is not the first non-profit I’ve worked with, and CiviCRM is not the first constituent/donor management system I’ve worked with. As I thought about my past experience and my experience at Creative Commons, I realized that CiviCRM is a key piece of infrastructure that enables Creative Commons to fulfill its mission, and to do so in a responsible way. Using CiviCRM is not just a question of free vs. proprietary software: it’s a question of responsible stewardship. CiviCRM and other free software allows us to fulfill our mission in a responsible, sustainable way. I think this is important to think about, so I’ll be talking about why I think this is the case. I’ll touch on how CiviCRM fits into Creative Commons, how it supports our mission, why I think <span class="caps">FLOSS</span> infrastructure ([<span class="caps">STRIKEOUT</span>:including]especially Civi) is essential for non-profits and grassroots organizations, and what I think is on the horizon.

I hope you’ll join me next month at CiviCon; you can [register now][1]  (space is limited). The [list of proposed sessions][7]  is online, and it looks like a really interesting day.
