I wrote about [our roll-out][1]  of [Hudson][2]  on the [<span class="caps">CC</span> Labs blog][3] . I wanted to note a few things about deploying that, primarily for my own reference. Hudson has some great documentation, but I found Joe Heck’s [step by step instructions][4]  on using Hudson for Python projects particularly helpful. We’re using [nose][5]  for most of our projects, and [buildout][6]  creates a <tt class="docutils literal">nosetest</tt> script wrapper that Hudson runs to generate pass/fail reports.

[Setting up coverage][7]  is on the [todo list][8] , but it appears that our particular combination of libraries has at least one strange issue: when [cc.license][9]  uses [Jinja2][10]  to load a template, coverage thinks it’s a Python source file (maybe it uses an import hook or something? haven’t looked) and tries to tokenize it when generating the xml report. [Ka-boom][11] . (This has apparently already been [reported][12] .)

Another item in the “maybe/someday” file is using [Tox][13]  to run the tests using multiple versions of Python (example configuration for [Tox + Hudson][14]  exists). I can see that this is a critical part of the process when releasing libraries for others to consume. We have slightly less surface area — all the servers run the same version of Python — but it’d be great to know exactly what our possible deployment parameters are.

Overall Hudson already feels like it’s adding to our sanity. I just received my copy of [Continuous Delivery][15] , so I think this is the start of something wonderful.
