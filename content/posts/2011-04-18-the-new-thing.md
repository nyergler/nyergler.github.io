There’s lots of change going on in my life right now, and the most visible external indication of that is my job: April 15 was my last day at [Creative Commons][1] . I’ll be joining the engineering team at [Eventbrite][2]  in early May. I’m really excited to be joining Eventbrite, and am really looking forward to seeing what it’s like to work on a consumer web product.

Someday I’ll figure out how to write about why I’m making the move, and why now; for now, it’s the new thing in my life, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it goes.
