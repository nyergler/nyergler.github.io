Armin Ronacher is one of my favorite Python bloggers these days, and his post [Python Packaging: Hate, hate, hate everywhere][1]  continues the trend of context and depth. You should read it. I immediately identified with the title: setuptools/easy_install isn’t (wasn’t?) perfect and it had maintenance problems, but when I get pull requests that reference [propoganda][2]  labeling it as “craptastic”, I feel a little sad.
