> I had no answer except I love Frank O’Hara which I didn’t voice because I knew
> it was not the answer. — [Dear Poet, To Survival][1] , Melissa Fondakowski

I read this poem weekly, reminding me to get outside myself.

(I also love that Melissa uses links in the poem, taking advantage of the medium
to open additional paths.)
