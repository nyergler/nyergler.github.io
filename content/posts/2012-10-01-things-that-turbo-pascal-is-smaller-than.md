<span class="caps">BASIC</span> may have been the first programming language I learned, but I really cut my teeth on Pascal during and immediately after high school. I’d be hard pressed to generate Pascal code of any sort today, but I remember how Turbo Pascal just **felt** like a more powerful medium, and arguably was an early step in this career I have built. All in 39,731 bytes.
