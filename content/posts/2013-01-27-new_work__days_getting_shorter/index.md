This was a fun piece to work on. It's based on [this photo][1]  (used with
permission, albeit after the fact), which I've been staring at off and on for
months. The most interesting thing to me is how the rainbow roll turned out (the
gradient in the image). The ink at the top is a magenta with a little blue in
it, and the ink at the bottom is mostly opaque white, with a little black in it
to make it about the color of concrete or pavement. But the black shadow at the
bottom masks most of the pure gray color, and the opaque white in the gray seems
to really bring out the blue that's in the magenta. Totally unexpected, but very
pleasing to my eye.
