In the process of working on [Golden Gate][1]  last year, I printed the black plate on its own a few times. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with watercolors recently, and this is my latest attempt at mixing watercolors with my printmaking. I like how different it feels from the four plate print version. In [Art <span class="amp">&</span> Fear][2] , the authors talk about how every piece necessarily contains within it the seeds of what comes next: something you want to experiment with, try to do differently, take a little further. Part of what&#8217;s been so satisfying about experimenting with watercolors is that that seed is obvious, and at the same time I&#8217;m able to enjoy where I am today. That balance, appreciating what I&#8217;m doing today while at the same time feeling energized about where I&#8217;m going, is difficult and often fleeting. So I&#8217;m trying to enjoy it while it&#8217;s here.
