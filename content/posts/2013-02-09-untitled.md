Shortly after I finished &#8220;[Golden Gate][1] &#8221; last year I decided I needed to do a companion piece depicting the _other_ bridge in San Francisco. I pulled the first prints of the new piece on Wednesday, and I think it&#8217;s pretty interesting how it turned out. Just like on _&#8220;Golden Gate&#8221;_, I tried to stretch technically. One of the plates &#8212; the sky and water &#8212; is cut in two so I could ink the gradient the way I wanted to. When carving the water I limited myself to a rounded edge carving tool to try and make it more &#8220;shimmering&#8221;. And the cables on the bridge are represented using carved lines against the sky. All three experiments feel pretty successful to me.

When I was printing &#8220;[Days Getting Shorter][2] &#8220;, I experienced how much fun printing multiplate prints can be when the registration is loose. The loose registration on those plates meant that I could focus on inking, colors, and other things, and the registration just sort of happened. The registration on this piece is much tighter, and of the five I printed I only got one where it&#8217;s really right on. But even the ones where&#8217;s it&#8217;s a little off don&#8217;t feel like failures to me: I think because there&#8217;s so much going on, it&#8217;s easy to enjoy other parts of the image. And working on tight registration is something I can practice in upcoming work.
