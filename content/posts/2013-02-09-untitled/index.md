Shortly after I finished "[Golden Gate][1]" last year I decided I needed to do a
companion piece depicting the _other_ bridge in San Francisco. I pulled the
first prints of the new piece on Wednesday, and I think it's pretty interesting
how it turned out. Just like on _"Golden Gate"_, I tried to stretch technically.
One of the plates --- the sky and water --- is cut in two so I could ink the
gradient the way I wanted to. When carving the water I limited myself to a
rounded edge carving tool to try and make it more "shimmering". And the cables
on the bridge are represented using carved lines against the sky. All three
experiments feel pretty successful to me.

When I was printing "[Days Getting Shorter][2]", I experienced how much fun
printing multiplate prints can be when the registration is loose. The loose
registration on those plates meant that I could focus on inking, colors, and
other things, and the registration just sort of happened. The registration on
this piece is much tighter, and of the five I printed I only got one where it's
really right on. But even the ones where's it's a little off don't feel like
failures to me: I think because there's so much going on, it's easy to enjoy
other parts of the image. And working on tight registration is something I can
practice in upcoming work.
