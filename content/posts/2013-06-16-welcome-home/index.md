Richard and I just moved from South Beach back to the area I lived in when I
first moved to San Francisco, and we first started dating. We've been in the new
place for a couple weeks now, and it already feels like we're more in the city
than we were before: closer to friends, closer to things to do in the evenings,
and more in a neighborhood. I was in the studio on a Wednesday evening, just
days before we moved, and I wanted to commemorate our new home. This is what
came out. It's not a literal drawing of the front gate and building, but it sort
of takes the elements and rearranges them a bit. It's one of the first things
I've done where I just drew directly on the plate before carving, instead of
doing a drawing first. Of course, I forgot to reverse it, so I still wound up
tracing what I'd drawn, cleaning off the plates, and then re-drawing it. Sigh.
