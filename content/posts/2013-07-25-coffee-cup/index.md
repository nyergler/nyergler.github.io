I wanted to practice using lines to describe, rather than outline, shapes and surfaces, so I took a picture of a coffee cup on a sunny day and decided to try and make a print from it. I worked small and (relatively) simple to avoid investing too much time in what is (effectively) a practice piece.

It was pretty instructive to carve this in an afternon, and then print it on Wednesday. Because it was small project, I was able to remember what I expected when I was carving, and compare that to what came out. There were a few things that came out as expected, and a few that didn't. That was sort of the point.
