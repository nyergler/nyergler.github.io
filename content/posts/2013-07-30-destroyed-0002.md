  I&#8217;m <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2013/07/29/destroyed-0001/">blogging my way</a> through Gary Bernhardt&#8217;s excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a> series of screencasts. If you write software, you should probably go buy it today.

[Episode 0002][1]  of Destroy All Software talks about <tt class="docutils literal">nil</tt> in Ruby. I&#8217;m not a Rubyist. I may be someday, but I&#8217;m not today, so I just imagined he was talking about <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> in Python with weird syntax. This episode is really how returning a <tt class="docutils literal">nil</tt> value can lead to exceptions that are _miles_ away from where they actually originated. Gary demonstrates this with a little [Rails][2]  app, and I found myself nodding along: I see this with some frequency in the [Eventbrite][3]  codebase, where a domain model&#8217;s property is set to <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>, and at a later point other code tries to call a method on that value.

You can, of course, write your own property descriptor (in Python) that checks for <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> and raises an exception when that value is set. At least then the error is localized to when it&#8217;s really being set to (or returning) <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>. But what you really want is to avoid the error altogether. Gary shows a couple ways to potentially do that, including inverting the relationship between domain models, and introducing a new model instead of just setting a property on an existing one.
