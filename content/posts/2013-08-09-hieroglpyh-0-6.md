I just uploaded [Hieroglyph][1]  0.6 to [PyPI][2] . This release contains a handful of new features, as well as fixes for a few bugs that people encountered. Some highlights:

<ul class="simple">
  <li>
    Doug Hellmann contributed support for displaying <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#presenter-notes">presenter notes</a> in the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#presenter-console">console</a> using the <tt class="docutils literal">note</tt> directive.
  </li>
  <li>
    tjadevries contributed a fix for the stylesheet used when printing slides, which should prevent modern browsers from inserting a page break in the middle of a slide.
  </li>
  <li>
    Slide numbering has been reimplemented, and received additional testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#create-a-project">hieroglyph-quickstart</a> script has been added to make it easier to generate an empty project with hieroglyph enabled.
  </li>
</ul>

See the [<span class="caps">NEWS</span>][3]  for the full details.

I&#8217;ve also started writing some automated tests for Hieroglyph. These are a little too involved to properly be called &#8220;unit tests&#8221;, but they&#8217;re being run using Travis <span class="caps">CI</span> now, which should help avoid regressions as I fix bugs in edge cases.

I spent a few days at <span class="caps">OSCON</span> about a week ago, and once again had the pleasure of attending Damian Conway&#8217;s &#8220;Presentation Aikido&#8221;. There are several things he talked about that I could be doing better with my talks. This release of Hieroglyph addresses one of them (quick fade or cut to the next slide, as opposed to the default slide left behavior). I&#8217;m working on what other changes I can make to Hieroglyph so that it&#8217;s dead simple to just _write_ your slides, and maximize what your attendees take away.
