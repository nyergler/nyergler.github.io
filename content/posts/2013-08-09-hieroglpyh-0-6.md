I just uploaded [Hieroglyph][1] 0.6 to [PyPI][2] . This release contains a
handful of new features, as well as fixes for a few bugs that people
encountered. Some highlights:

* Doug Hellmann contributed support for displaying [presenter
  notes](http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#presenter-notes)
  in the
  [console](http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#presenter-console)
  using the `note` directive.
* tjadevries contributed a fix for the stylesheet used when printing slides,
  which should prevent modern browsers from inserting a page break in the middle
  of a slide.
* Slide numbering has been reimplemented, and received additional testing.
* A
  [hieroglyph-quickstart](http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#create-a-project)
  script has been added to make it easier to generate an empty project with
  hieroglyph enabled.

See the [NEWS][3]  for the full details.

I've also started writing some automated tests for Hieroglyph. These are a
little too involved to properly be called "unit tests", but they're being run
using Travis CI now, which should help avoid regressions as I fix bugs in edge
cases.

I spent a few days at OSCON about a week ago, and once again had the pleasure of
attending Damian Conway's "Presentation Aikido". There are several things he
talked about that I could be doing better with my talks. This release of
Hieroglyph addresses one of them (quick fade or cut to the next slide, as
opposed to the default slide left behavior). I'm working on what other changes I
can make to Hieroglyph so that it's dead simple to just _write_ your slides, and
maximize what your attendees take away.
