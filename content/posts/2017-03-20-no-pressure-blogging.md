If I had [something in the works that I felt I could label an "essay"][1], I think I'd feel pressure. And that's at least part of the reason for a three year hiatus on the blog.

It'll be interesting to see if [micro.blog][2] brings back some of the spontaneity I felt with [identi.ca][3] back in the day. Hopefully without the passive aggressive, cringe inducing snark.
