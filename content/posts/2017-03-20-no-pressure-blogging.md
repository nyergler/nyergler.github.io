If I had [something in the works that I felt I could label an &#8220;essay&#8221;][1], I think I&#8217;d feel pressure. And that&#8217;s at least part of the reason for a three year hiatus on the blog.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if [micro.blog][2] brings back some of the spontaneity I felt with [identi.ca][3] back in the day. Hopefully without the passive aggressive, cringe inducing snark.
