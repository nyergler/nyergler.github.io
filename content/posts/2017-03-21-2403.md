Working on an update for [Effective Django][1], I spent a little time looking at [Pollen][2] and [Racket][3] this week trying to understand how it’s different/better than [Sphinx][4]. I have a problem (obsession) with “programmable documentation” tools. Came to the conclusion that it solves a problem similar to Sphinx: Python extensions are Racket functions, `..` is spelled `◊`, the `doctree` is X-expressions, etc. Also, MB’s [templates][5] [are][6] [gorgeous][7].
