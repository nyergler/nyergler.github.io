I was in the studio last week, printing a new piece, the Tower Theater. Despite
taking the source photo eighteen months ago, I only started drawing and carving
a week before printing. I've been feeling a little out of practice, so I wanted
to do something in the way of practice: something that would give me some
practice carving, getting the feel for my tools back, without letting myself get
too caught up in what the outcome was going to be. And all in all, I'm pretty
pleased with the result: there are things I see that I'd do differently, but as
I read in Art & Fear, every piece has the seed of the next piece in it.
