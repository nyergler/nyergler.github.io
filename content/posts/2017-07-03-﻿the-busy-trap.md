[Tim Kreider writes][1]:

> Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration â€” it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.

There&#8217;s a voice in my head that says curiosity has to have an outcome, that if there isn&#8217;t something to show at the end, it&#8217;s not worth exploring. Nice to be reminded there are other perspectives.
