Has any book influenced me more? Challenged me more?

I brought one book with me to Lincoln this week, "Art & Fear", by David Bayles and Ted Orland. It's a book I've read several times, underlining passages, drawing stars in the margin, and occasionally double-underlining **just to be sure I know it's important.** And I still find new things that resonate each time I read it.

"Something about making art has to do with overcoming things, giving us a clear opportunity for doing things in ways we have always known we should do them."

"Making art can feel dangerous and revealing. Making art _is_ dangerous and revealing. Making art precipitates self-doubt, stirring deep waters that lay between what you known you should be, and what you fear you might be."
