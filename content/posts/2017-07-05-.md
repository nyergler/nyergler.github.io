Has any book influenced me more? Challenged me more?

I brought one book with me to Lincoln this week, &#8220;Art & Fear&#8221;, by David Bayles and Ted Orland. It&#8217;s a book I&#8217;ve read several times, underlining passages, drawing stars in the margin, and occasionally double-underlining **just to be sure I know it&#8217;s important.** And I still find new things that resonate each time I read it. <span id="selectionBoundary_1501116679161_4297083568553046" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;">ï»¿</span>

&#8220;Something about making art has to do with overcoming things, giving us a clear opportunity for doing things in ways we have always known we should do them.&#8221;

&#8220;Making art can feel dangerous and revealing. Making art _is_ dangerous and revealing. Making art precipitates self-doubt, stirring deep waters that lay between what you known you should be, and what you fear you might be.&#8221;
