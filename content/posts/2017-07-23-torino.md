I printed my last practice print yesterday before heading to Lincoln. I had this
drawn on the plate for the better part of a year, based on a photo from one of
my trips to Torino for Creative Commons years ago. Friday evening I sat down and
started carving; yesterday afternoon I printed it. 8" x 10" on
Pescia.
