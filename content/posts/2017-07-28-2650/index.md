I’m in Nebraska this week participating in the Color Woodcut Printmaking at
@constellationstudios today. I finished my first project today. Pretty pleased
with the overall result, especially since I don’t normally do abstract. Thanks
to @robsnyderorigami for the crease pattern that formed the foundation for this
piece. #printmaking #relief #foldandprint #woodcut
