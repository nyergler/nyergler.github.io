Today I finished my first reduction woodcut. I expected to be finished quickly
this morning, but getting it right took the majority of my morning. I was adding
some darker lines to ground the piece, and it took some experimenting to figure
out where they needed to be to make me happy.

The final print looks nothing like I expected when I began the process. But
then, it's been mostly about improvisation. I wouldn't make all the same choices
if I were doing it again (the raspberry color, in particular, feels like a
whimsical choice gone awry). And, I'm very pleased with the result.

This morning Karen introduced the second project and did a brief demonstration.
The second project is a two-block reduction print, where the blocks form
"postive" and "negative" spaces. That is, what's carved away on one is left
behind on the other. The result is that you get "woodcut edges" along your color
spaces, and you have more options for reduction. It also lets you break the rule
of reduction printmaking that says the first cuts you make expose the color of
the paper. Because you have two blocks in play, those first cuts may actually
expose color from the other block. It took me some time to figure out what I
wanted to do for this project, and I'm going a little more representational for
this one, but not aiming for realism.

Before the end of the day I transferred the image onto two blocks (along with
registration marks), and carved "channels" around the parts of each block that
will stay to aid with inking. I also cut two masks to use tomorrow morning for
laying down my first passes of color.

I'm trying to keep in mind everything I learned about layering color in the last
three days so I can move more decisively tomorrow and Sunday. I think finishing
this is going to be a stretch, but I'm going to do my best.
