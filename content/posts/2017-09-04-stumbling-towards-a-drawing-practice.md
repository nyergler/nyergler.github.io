I&#8217;ve been aware for some time that improving my drawing skills would probably have a big impact on all parts of my artistic practice. I did a short course based on [Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain][1] a few years ago that helped, but I&#8217;ve lacked a real _practice_ around it.

I came across a post on Medium last week about [six drawing exercises][2], two for dexterity and four for &#8220;seeing&#8221;. As a first exercise I converted them to a drawing in [Paper][3] so I could easily refer to them in my sketchbook.
