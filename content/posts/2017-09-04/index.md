I've been aware for some time that improving my drawing skills would probably
have a big impact on all parts of my artistic practice. I did a short course
based on [Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain][1] a few years ago that
helped, but I've lacked a real _practice_ around it.

I came across a post on Medium last week about [six drawing exercises][2], two
for dexterity and four for "seeing". As a first exercise I converted them to a
drawing in [Paper][3] so I could easily refer to them in my sketchbook.
