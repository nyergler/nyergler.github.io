Over the last two months I've had the opportunity to explore three things that are new to me and how they fit together: Rust, WebAssembly, and OpenGL. I'm going to focus on the first two in this post, with a later post on how OpenGL fits into it.

_All code from this post, along with a working example, is available [on GitHub][1]._

I've been interested in Rust for a while, and did some experimenting with it around two years ago. My experiment at the time was rebuilding a tiny service in the Remind architecture using it, just to get a feel. The service was simple: respond to HTTP requests, manage state in Redis, emit some telemetry. The previous iteration was built using Go, which seemed like a natural fit for something so network I/O bound. I was curious how moving from a language with concurrency primitives to one while strives to remove the underlying issues with concurrency would feel. My recollection from that experience was that the initial startup cost was "higher" than with Go, but that once I'd let go of my preconceptions about how things were supposed to work, it went pretty smoothly. I also recalled that the compiler gave the most useful feedback of any I'd used.

WebAssembly is something I've been watching out the corner of my eye. It's not the first effort to run "native-ish" code inside the browser (see NaCL, asm.js, emscripten), but it was interesting that it had the weight of standardization behind it. I'll admit that I have some ambivalence about the browser moving further away from being an Agent of the User (er, user-agent), but the idea that you could share complex code between web and mobile applications was appealing. When I saw that Rust had [landed a WebAssembly backend][2] in the nightly builds, I decided to figure out how you'd go about building a library in Rust that could be consumed on the Web and with iOS.

### Targeting WebAssembly with Rust

There are plenty of examples of how to target WebAssembly with Rust using emscripten. I was interested in figuring out how to do it without the emscripten toolchain, though. I read many of these posts for "inspiration" (see Bibliography below), but had to figure out a few things myself.

First, you need to install the nightly toolchain in order to take advantage of WebAssembly. If you're using rustup (and I think you should), this is as simple as:

    $ rustup install nightly

After that you can target WebAssembly with any Cargo build by specifying the toolchain and target:

    $ cargo +nightly build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

WebAssembly's "mental model" is one of dynamically loaded modules. In order to create a `.wasm` file you can load in your browser, you need to specify that you're building a [`cdylib` crate][3]. You can do this by specifying the `crate_type` in `Cargo.toml`.

    [lib]
    crate_type=["cdylib"]

Let's look at a relatively simple function in Rust that we want to make available via WebAssembly.

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn sum(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}
```

You'll note that the signature has a couple of extra bits:

- `#[no_mangle]`
- `extern`
- `"C"`

I've seen multiple people talk about using [wasm-gc][4] on the result, so I did, too. Is it necessary? It's not clear to me at the moment, but it does shrink the size, which I suppose is useful when it comes to transfer and load times.

So my final build script looked something like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    set -euo pipefail

    cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

    mkdir build/
    wasm-gc ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasm_oxide.wasm ./build/rust_oxide.wasm

### Consuming WebAssembly

Once you have your `.wasm` file, it's time to load it up.

`wasm-utils.js` from MDN --- https://github.com/mdn/webassembly-examples

Webpack/running/example

wargo-loader, et al

### Putting it together

So if it's _just that easy_, what's the big deal? Well&#8230; it turns out that WebAssembly only speaks in floats and ints (i32, i64, f32, f64). This means that you have to think a bit about how
