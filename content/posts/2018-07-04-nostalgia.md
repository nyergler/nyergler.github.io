I read that 2018 was [the final year of Open Source Bridge][1]. Reading that I felt sadness, as well as gratitude the organizers were able to choose that. I spoke at the inaugural Open Source Bridge, and my memory of that is that it was such a refreshing vibe compared to the other conferences I was attending at the time (OSCON, Semantic World). There was space for self care (yoga), for weird ideas, and for community in a way I didn&#8217;t experience at other conferences. I started to write this as a status update, and realized that these feelings about Open Source Bridge are part of a larger wave of nostalgia for the late aughts I&#8217;ve been feeling lately.

The first Open Source Bridge took place in 2009. I had been living in San Francisco for two years and was working at Creative Commons. My role at CC had morphed from &#8220;figure out what we could build to engage people with the commons&#8221; to &#8220;figure out our technical strategy and how we fit with the You Tubes of the world&#8221;. I was a lot better at the former; at the very least I enjoyed it more. But there was still something there that I felt energized being part of. There was a community that I appreciated and valued. I&#8217;ve [reflected in the past][2] that identi.ca formed the core of this online community for me. It also lived on blogs and in the #cc IRC channels.

So I guess it&#8217;s appropriate that some of this nostalgia is undoubtedly triggered by all the awesome Indie* work being done. Just this week I learned about [Indie Book Club][3] and [Indie Web Ring][4]. And while both are simple, that&#8217;s sort of the point: I&#8217;m happy they both exist, because [I hypothesize] they help me connect with a larger community while being my whole self online. Being my whole self means that I &#8220;show up&#8221; in a solid, singular way: you come to my blog and get printmaking, scifi quotes, Python advice, sewing; you get _me_.

My talk at the inaugural Open Source Bridge was entitled [&#8220;A Database Called the Web&#8221;][5]. It was the second and last time I presented that talk, which was a shame because I don&#8217;t think I ever really got the kinks worked out. Creative Commons was founded with this technical layer under girding the licenses, and &#8220;A Database Called the Web&#8221; was my attempt to articulate that decentralized, federated vision in a way that didn&#8217;t start with RDF, XHTML, etc. And that&#8217;s why in addition to feeling some nostalgia I also feel some hope: it seems like with ~ 10 years of time (and a lot of heartache) people have moved on to building decentralized things that they want to see exist in the world. And that makes me happy.
