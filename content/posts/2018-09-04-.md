I bought a Windows laptop --- a Dell XPS 13 to be specific --- a couple months ago to try it out. Two weeks later the refreshed Macbook Pros were released, and even some questionable design decisions on Apple's part, I returned my Dell and bought the Macbook Pro. The Dell hardware is arguably a better value, and Windows 10 is not the Windows XP I last used regularly. I described it to a friend in this way: "I don't want to use my computer primarily for configuring/figuring out my computer". In other words, yes, it was possible to do what I wanted to do with it, but I had to figure out how to do that at each step. The fact I live my work and mobile life on Apple products meant that I was doomed to a cross-OS world, which did not give me much hope for ever feeling "settled".

I share this anecdote because it's sort of how I feel about "IndieWeb" things these days. I think I feel more interested in getting them to work than I did my XPS 13, but I still sort of feel like I wind up using, say Micro.blog, to figure out how to use Micro.blog as a part of the larger Indieweb.

This isn't the first time I've felt a general dissatisfaction with my tools: this blog has lived as TextPattern, Blosxom, PyBlosxom, WordPress, MoinMoin, Pelican, and finally WordPress, again. [I may have the order a little off, and it's even possible I'm missing one or two iterations.] I came back to WordPress earlier this year not because I love it all that much, but out of fatigue/resignation: I don't want to spend all my energy just figuring out my tools.

I read about aggregators, readers, "publishing clients", and think, "YES! Decentralization! _This_ is the world I want to be living in!" But then I read about IndieAuth and try to figure out, "wait, so am I authorizing or authenticating? Am I making a bunch of little silos?" quickly followed by "my brain hurts!"

Case in point: IndieBookClub has a cute name and seems like a clever idea. I deleted my GoodReads account some time ago because it felt like I was reading just to meet a goal there or mark another book as "read". Even so, I still like to share what I'm reading, especially if it moves me. So I tried IndieBookClub and successfully shared a post on Micro.blog. _But&#8230;_ it doesn't seem like the "post kind" metadata makes it to Micro.blog, which seems like a problem for aggregation. It lives on at IBC, but I'm not sure what good that does me.

So what I find myself wanting is "IndieWeb-in-a-box":
