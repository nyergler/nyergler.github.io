An interesting [write-up of the Haiku Vector Image
Format](https://blog.leahhanson.us/post/recursecenter2016/haiku_icons.html);
what particularly stood out to me, though, was this description of vector
formats:

I've always thought of them in terms of math vectors, and while accurate, that
doesn't really capture _why_ we might prefer vectors to bitmaps.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the "why" is more interesting.
