Lerna &#8212; manage package versions

Thought I needed to use a yarn workspace; turns out that made things worse in some cases: a package specified in both the workspace + package got installed twice (both versions). This usually didn&#8217;t matter, but sometimes Typescript `@types` got very angry.

If you want to use npm \_and\_ you want to hoist, then:

  * your package.json has to define \_all\_ dependencies
  * you have to bootstrap with `--hoist`

Why would you want to hoist?

It speeds up bootstrapping and (potentially?) helps keep versions organized.
