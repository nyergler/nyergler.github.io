I've read this [summary of iterators in
Go](https://ewencp.org/blog/golang-iterators/index.html) repeatedly over the
years. This morning I read [Generators in
Go](https://blog.haardiek.org/generators-in-go) and realized I'd failed to
internalize what might be the most natural-feeling option: `channel` + `range`.

Early `break` remains a garbage collection issue, though.
